mimalloc</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>mimalloc (pronounced "me-malloc") is a general purpose allocator with excellent performance characteristics. Initially developed by Daan Leijen for the runtime systems of the <a href="https://koka-lang.github.io">Koka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean">Lean</a> languages.</p>
<p>Latest release : <code>v3.0.2</code> (beta) (2025-03-06). <br  />
 Latest v2 release: <code>v2.2.2</code> (2025-03-06). <br  />
 Latest v1 release: <code>v1.9.2</code> (2024-03-06).</p>
<p>mimalloc is a drop-in replacement for <code>malloc</code> and can be used in other programs without code changes, for example, on dynamically linked ELF-based systems (Linux, BSD, etc.) you can use it as: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so  myprogram</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> It also includes a way to dynamically override the default allocator in Windows. Notable aspects of the design include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>small and consistent</b>: the library is about 10k LOC using simple and consistent data structures. This makes it very suitable to integrate and adapt in other projects. For runtime systems it provides hooks for a monotonic <em>heartbeat</em> and deferred freeing (for bounded worst-case times with reference counting). Partly due to its simplicity, mimalloc has been ported to many systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, WASM, various BSD's, Haiku, MUSL, etc) and has excellent support for dynamic overriding. At the same time, it is an industrial strength allocator that runs (very) large scale distributed services on thousands of machines with excellent worst case latencies.</li>
<li><b>free list sharding</b>: instead of one big free list (per size class) we have many smaller lists per "mimalloc page" which reduces fragmentation and increases locality &ndash; things that are allocated close in time get allocated close in memory. (A mimalloc page contains blocks of one size class and is usually 64KiB on a 64-bit system).</li>
<li><b>free list multi-sharding</b>: the big idea! Not only do we shard the free list per mimalloc page, but for each page we have multiple free lists. In particular, there is one list for thread-local <code>free</code> operations, and another one for concurrent <code>free</code> operations. Free-ing from another thread can now be a single CAS without needing sophisticated coordination between threads. Since there will be thousands of separate free lists, contention is naturally distributed over the heap, and the chance of contending on a single location will be low &ndash; this is quite similar to randomized algorithms like skip lists where adding a random oracle removes the need for a more complex algorithm.</li>
<li><b>eager page purging</b>: when a "page" becomes empty (with increased chance due to free list sharding) the memory is marked to the OS as unused (reset or decommitted) reducing (real) memory pressure and fragmentation, especially in long running programs.</li>
<li><b>secure</b>: <em>mimalloc</em> can be built in secure mode, adding guard pages, randomized allocation, encrypted free lists, etc. to protect against various heap vulnerabilities. The performance penalty is usually around 10% on average over our benchmarks.</li>
<li><b>first-class heaps</b>: efficiently create and use multiple heaps to allocate across different regions. A heap can be destroyed at once instead of deallocating each object separately.</li>
<li><b>bounded</b>: it does not suffer from <em>blowup</em> [1], has bounded worst-case allocation times (<em>wcat</em>) (upto OS primitives), bounded space overhead (~0.2% meta-data, with low internal fragmentation), and has no internal points of contention using only atomic operations.</li>
<li><b>fast</b>: In our benchmarks (see below), <em>mimalloc</em> outperforms other leading allocators (<em>jemalloc</em>, <em>tcmalloc</em>, <em>Hoard</em>, etc), and often uses less memory. A nice property is that it does consistently well over a wide range of benchmarks. There is also good huge OS page support for larger server programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc">documentation</a> gives a full overview of the API. You can read more on the design of <em>mimalloc</em> in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mimalloc-free-list-sharding-in-action">technical report</a> which also has detailed benchmark results.</p>

Branches</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>master</code>: latest stable release (still based on <code>dev2</code>).</li>
<li><code>dev</code>: development branch for mimalloc v1. Use this branch for submitting PR's.</li>
<li><code>dev2</code>: development branch for mimalloc v2. This branch is downstream of <code>dev</code> (and is essentially equal to <code>dev</code> except for <code>src/segment.c</code>). Uses larger sliced segments to manage mimalloc pages that can reduce fragmentation.</li>
<li><code>dev3</code>: development branch for mimalloc v3-beta. This branch is downstream of <code>dev</code>. This version simplifies the lock-free ownership of previous versions, has no thread-local segments any more. This improves sharing of memory between threads, and on certain large workloads may use less memory with less fragmentation.</li>
</ul>

Releases</h3>
<ul>
<li>2025-03-06, <code>v1.9.2</code>, <code>v2.2.2</code>, <code>v3.0.2-beta</code>: Various small bug and build fixes. Add <code>mi_options_print</code>, <code>mi_arenas_print</code>, and the experimental <code>mi_stat_get</code> and <code>mi_stat_get_json</code>. Add <code>mi_thread_set_in_threadpool</code> and <code>mi_heap_set_numa_affinity</code> (v3 only). Add vcpkg portfile. Upgrade mimalloc-redirect to v1.3.2. <code>MI_OPT_ARCH</code> is off by default now but still assumes armv8.1-a on arm64 for fast atomic operations. Add QNX support.</li>
<li>2025-01-03, <code>v1.8.9</code>, <code>v2.1.9</code>, <code>v3.0.1-alpha</code>: Interim release. Support Windows arm64. New guarded build that can place OS guard pages behind objects to catch buffer overflows as they occur. Many small fixes: build on Windows arm64, cygwin, riscV, and dragonfly; fix Windows static library initialization to account for thread local destructors (in Rust/C++); macOS tag change; macOS TLS slot fix; improve stats; consistent <code>mimalloc.dll</code> on Windows (instead of <code>mimalloc-override.dll</code>); fix mimalloc-redirect on Win11 H2; add 0-byte to canary; upstream CPython fixes; reduce .bss size; allow fixed TLS slot on Windows for improved performance.</li>
<li>2024-05-21, <code>v1.8.7</code>, <code>v2.1.7</code>: Fix build issues on less common platforms. Started upstreaming patches from the CPython <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113141#issuecomment-2119255217">integration</a>. Upstream <code>vcpkg</code> patches.</li>
<li>2024-05-13, <code>v1.8.6</code>, <code>v2.1.6</code>: Fix build errors on various (older) platforms. Refactored aligned allocation.</li>
<li>2024-04-22, <code>v1.8.4</code>, <code>v2.1.4</code>: Fixes various bugs and build issues. Add <code>MI_LIBC_MUSL</code> cmake flag for musl builds. Free-ing code is refactored into a separate module (<code><a class="el" href="free_8c.html">free.c</a></code>). Mimalloc page info is simplified with the block size directly available (and new <code>block_size_shift</code> to improve aligned block free-ing). New approach to collection of abandoned segments: When a thread terminates the segments it owns are abandoned (containing still live objects) and these can be reclaimed by other threads. We no longer use a list of abandoned segments but this is now done using bitmaps in arena's which is more concurrent (and more aggressive). Abandoned memory can now also be reclaimed if a thread frees an object in an abandoned page (which can be disabled using <code>mi_option_abandoned_reclaim_on_free</code>). The option <code>mi_option_max_segment_reclaim</code> gives a maximum percentage of abandoned segments that can be reclaimed per try (=10%).</li>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md33"></a>
Usage</h3>
<p>mimalloc is used in various large scale low-latency services and programs, for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bing.com"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Bing_logo.svg" alt="" height="50" align="left" style="pointer-events: none;" class="inline"/></a> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Microsoft_Azure_Logo.svg" alt="" height="50" align="left" style="pointer-events: none;" class="inline"/></a> <a href="https://deathstrandingpc.505games.com"><img src="doc/ds-logo.png" alt="" height="100" class="inline"/></a> <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/WhatsNew/Builds/ReleaseNotes/4_25/"><img src="doc/unreal-logo.svg" alt="" height="100" style="pointer-events: none;" class="inline"/></a> <a href="https://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/"><img src="doc/spades-logo.png" alt="" height="100" class="inline"/></a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md34"></a>
Building</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md35"></a>
Windows</h2>
<p>Open <code>ide/vs2022/mimalloc.sln</code> in Visual Studio 2022 and build. The <code>mimalloc-lib</code> project builds a static library (in <code>out/msvc-x64</code>), while the <code>mimalloc-override-dll</code> project builds DLL for overriding malloc in the entire program.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md36"></a>
Linux, macOS, BSD, etc.</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://cmake.org"><code>cmake</code></a> as the build system:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; mkdir -p out/release</div>
<div class="line">&gt; cd out/release</div>
<div class="line">&gt; cmake ../..</div>
<div class="line">&gt; make</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This builds the library as a shared (dynamic) library (<code>.so</code> or <code>.dylib</code>), a static library (<code>.a</code>), and as a single object file (<code>.o</code>).</p>
<p><code>&gt; sudo make install</code> (install the library and header files in <code>/usr/local/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/include</code>)</p>
<p>You can build the debug version which does many internal checks and maintains detailed statistics as:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; mkdir -p out/debug</div>
<div class="line">&gt; cd out/debug</div>
<div class="line">&gt; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..</div>
<div class="line">&gt; make</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This will name the shared library as <code>libmimalloc-debug.so</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, you can build a <em>secure</em> version that uses guard pages, encrypted free lists, etc., as:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; mkdir -p out/secure</div>
<div class="line">&gt; cd out/secure</div>
<div class="line">&gt; cmake -DMI_SECURE=ON ../..</div>
<div class="line">&gt; make</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This will name the shared library as <code>libmimalloc-secure.so</code>. Use <code>cmake ../.. -LH</code> to see all the available build options.</p>
<p>The examples use the default compiler. If you like to use another, use:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ../..</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md37"></a>
Cmake with Visual Studio</h2>
<p>You can also use cmake on Windows. Open a Visual Studio 2022 development prompt and invoke <code>cmake</code> with the right <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2017%202022.html">generator</a> and architecture, like:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; cmake ..\.. -G &quot;Visual Studio 17 2022&quot; -A x64 -DMI_OVERRIDE=ON</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The cmake build type is specified when actually building, for example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; cmake --build . --config=Release</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>You can also install the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild?view=msvc-170#install-1">LLVM toolset</a> on Windows to build with the <code>clang-cl</code> compiler directly:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; cmake ../.. -G &quot;Visual Studio 17 2022&quot; -T ClangCl</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md38"></a>
Single Source</h2>
<p>You can also directly build the single <code><a class="el" href="static_8c.html">src/static.c</a></code> file as part of your project without needing <code>cmake</code> at all. Make sure to also add the mimalloc <code>include</code> directory to the include path.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md39"></a>
Using the Library</h1>
<p>The preferred usage is including <code>&lt;<a class="el" href="mimalloc_8h.html">mimalloc.h</a>&gt;</code>, linking with the shared- or static library, and using the <code>mi_malloc</code> API exclusively for allocation. For example, </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; gcc -o myprogram -lmimalloc myfile.c</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>mimalloc uses only safe OS calls (<code>mmap</code> and <code>VirtualAlloc</code>) and can co-exist with other allocators linked to the same program. If you use <code>cmake</code>, you can simply use: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">find_package(mimalloc 1.8 REQUIRED)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> in your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> to find a locally installed mimalloc. Then use either: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> to link with the shared (dynamic) library, or: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc-static)</div>

<p>For best performance in C++ programs, it is also recommended to override the global <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> operators. For convenience, mimalloc provides <a href="include/mimalloc-new-delete.h"><code>mimalloc-new-delete.h</code></a> which does this for you &ndash; just include it in a single(!) source file in your project.

</div><!-- fragment --><p>The above model of using the <code>mi_</code> prefixed API is not always possible though in existing programs that already use the standard malloc interface, and another option is to override the standard malloc interface completely and redirect all calls to the <em>mimalloc</em> library instead .</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md40"></a>
Environment Options</h2>
<p>You can set further options either programmatically (using <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/group__options.html"><code>mi_option_set</code></a>), or via environment variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1</code>: show statistics when the program terminates.</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1</code>: show verbose messages.</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_SHOW_ERRORS=1</code>: show error and warning messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_ARENA_EAGER_COMMIT=2</code>: turns on eager commit for the large arenas (usually 1GiB) from which mimalloc allocates segments and pages. Set this to 2 (default) to only enable this on overcommit systems (e.g. Linux). Set this to 1 to enable explicitly on other systems as well (like Windows or macOS) which may improve performance (as the whole arena is committed at once). Note that eager commit only increases the commit but not the actual the peak resident set (rss) so it is generally ok to enable this.</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY=N</code>: the delay in <code>N</code> milli-seconds (by default <code>10</code>) after which mimalloc will purge OS pages that are not in use. This signals to the OS that the underlying physical memory can be reused which can reduce memory fragmentation especially in long running (server) programs. Setting <code>N</code> to <code>0</code> purges immediately when a page becomes unused which can improve memory usage but also decreases performance. Setting <code>N</code> to a higher value like <code>100</code> can improve performance (sometimes by a lot) at the cost of potentially using more memory at times. Setting it to <code>-1</code> disables purging completely.</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_PURGE_DECOMMITS=1</code>: By default "purging" memory means unused memory is decommitted (<code>MEM_DECOMMIT</code> on Windows, <code>MADV_DONTNEED</code> (which decresease rss immediately) on <code>mmap</code> systems). Set this to 0 to instead "reset" unused memory on a purge (<code>MEM_RESET</code> on Windows, generally <code>MADV_FREE</code> (which does not decrease rss immediately) on <code>mmap</code> systems). Mimalloc generally does not "free" OS memory but only "purges" OS memory, in other words, it tries to keep virtual address ranges and decommits within those ranges (to make the underlying physical memory available to other processes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Further options for large workloads and services:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_USE_NUMA_NODES=N</code>: pretend there are at most <code>N</code> NUMA nodes. If not set, the actual NUMA nodes are detected at runtime. Setting <code>N</code> to 1 may avoid problems in some virtual environments. Also, setting it to a lower number than the actual NUMA nodes is fine and will only cause threads to potentially allocate more memory across actual NUMA nodes (but this can happen in any case as NUMA local allocation is always a best effort but not guaranteed).</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_ALLOW_LARGE_OS_PAGES=0</code>: Set to 1 to use large OS pages (2 or 4MiB) when available; for some workloads this can significantly improve performance. When this option is disabled (default), it also disables transparent huge pages (THP) for the process (on Linux and Android). On Linux the default setting is 2 &ndash; this enables the use of large pages through THP only. Use <code>MIMALLOC_VERBOSE</code> to check if the large OS pages are enabled &ndash; usually one needs to explicitly give permissions for large OS pages (as on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows?view=sql-server-2017">Windows</a> and <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/tuning_and_optimizing_red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_oracle_9i_and_10g_databases/sect-oracle_9i_and_10g_tuning_guide-large_memory_optimization_big_pages_and_huge_pages-configuring_huge_pages_in_red_hat_enterprise_linux_4_or_5">Linux</a>). However, sometimes the OS is very slow to reserve contiguous physical memory for large OS pages so use with care on systems that can have fragmented memory (for that reason, we generally recommend to use <code>MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES</code> instead whenever possible).</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES=N</code>: where <code>N</code> is the number of 1GiB <em>huge</em> OS pages. This reserves the huge pages at startup and sometimes this can give a large (latency) performance improvement on big workloads. Usually it is better to not use <code>MIMALLOC_ALLOW_LARGE_OS_PAGES=1</code> in combination with this setting. Just like large OS pages, use with care as reserving contiguous physical memory can take a long time when memory is fragmented (but reserving the huge pages is done at startup only once). Note that we usually need to explicitly give permission for huge OS pages (as on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows?view=sql-server-2017">Windows</a> and <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/tuning_and_optimizing_red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_oracle_9i_and_10g_databases/sect-oracle_9i_and_10g_tuning_guide-large_memory_optimization_big_pages_and_huge_pages-configuring_huge_pages_in_red_hat_enterprise_linux_4_or_5">Linux</a>)). With huge OS pages, it may be beneficial to set the setting <code>MIMALLOC_EAGER_COMMIT_DELAY=N</code> (<code>N</code> is 1 by default) to delay the initial <code>N</code> segments (of 4MiB) of a thread to not allocate in the huge OS pages; this prevents threads that are short lived and allocate just a little to take up space in the huge OS page area (which cannot be purged as huge OS pages are pinned to physical memory). The huge pages are usually allocated evenly among NUMA nodes. We can use <code>MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES_AT=N</code> where <code>N</code> is the numa node (starting at 0) to allocate all the huge pages at a specific numa node instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use caution when using <code>fork</code> in combination with either large or huge OS pages: on a fork, the OS uses copy-on-write for all pages in the original process including the huge OS pages. When any memory is now written in that area, the OS will copy the entire 1GiB huge page (or 2MiB large page) which can cause the memory usage to grow in large increments.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md41"></a>
Secure Mode</h2>
<p><em>mimalloc</em> can be build in secure mode by using the <code>-DMI_SECURE=ON</code> flags in <code>cmake</code>. This build enables various mitigations to make mimalloc more robust against exploits. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>All internal mimalloc pages are surrounded by guard pages and the heap metadata is behind a guard page as well (so a buffer overflow exploit cannot reach into the metadata).</li>
<li>All free list pointers are <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/blob/783e3377f79ee82af43a0793910a9f2d01ac7863/include/mimalloc-internal.h#L396">encoded</a> with per-page keys which is used both to prevent overwrites with a known pointer, as well as to detect heap corruption.</li>
<li>Double free's are detected (and ignored).</li>
<li>The free lists are initialized in a random order and allocation randomly chooses between extension and reuse within a page to mitigate against attacks that rely on a predicable allocation order. Similarly, the larger heap blocks allocated by mimalloc from the OS are also address randomized.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, evaluate with care as part of an overall security strategy as all of the above are mitigations but not guarantees.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md42"></a>
Debug Mode</h2>
<p>When <em>mimalloc</em> is built using debug mode, (<code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug</code>), various checks are done at runtime to catch development errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistics are maintained in detail for each object size. They can be shown using <code>MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1</code> at runtime.</li>
<li>All objects have padding at the end to detect (byte precise) heap block overflows.</li>
<li>Double free's, and freeing invalid heap pointers are detected.</li>
<li>Corrupted free-lists and some forms of use-after-free are detected.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md43"></a>
Guarded Mode</h2>
<p><span id="guarded"><em>mimalloc</em> can be build in guarded mode using the <code>-DMI_GUARDED=ON</code> flags in <code>cmake</code>.</span> This enables placing OS guard pages behind certain object allocations to catch buffer overflows as they occur. This can be invaluable to catch buffer-overflow bugs in large programs. However, it also means that any object allocated with a guard page takes at least 8 KiB memory for the guard page and its alignment. As such, allocating a guard page for every allocation may be too expensive both in terms of memory, and in terms of performance with many system calls. Therefore, there are various environment variables (and options) to tune this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_GUARDED_SAMPLE_RATE=N</code>: Set the sample rate to <code>N</code> (by default 4000). This mode places a guard page behind every <code>N</code> suitable object allocations (per thread). Since the performance in guarded mode without placing guard pages is close to release mode, this can be used to enable guard pages even in production to catch latent buffer overflow bugs. Set the sample rate to <code>1</code> to guard every object, and to <code>0</code> to place no guard pages at all.</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_GUARDED_SAMPLE_SEED=N</code>: Start sampling at <code>N</code> (by default random). Can be used to reproduce a buffer overflow if needed.</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_GUARDED_MIN=N</code>, <code>MIMALLOC_GUARDED_MAX=N</code>: Minimal and maximal <em>rounded</em> object sizes for which a guard page is considered (<code>0</code> and <code>1GiB</code> respectively). If you suspect a buffer overflow occurs with an object of size 141, set the minimum and maximum to <code>148</code> and the sample rate to <code>1</code> to have all of those guarded.</li>
<li><code>MIMALLOC_GUARDED_PRECISE=1</code>: If we have an object of size 13, we would usually place it an aligned 16 bytes in front of the guard page. Using <code>MIMALLOC_GUARDED_PRECISE</code> places it exactly 13 bytes before a page so that even a 1 byte overflow is detected. This violates the C/C++ minimal alignment guarantees though so use with care.</li>
</ul>

Overriding Standard Malloc</h1>
<p>Overriding the standard <code>malloc</code> (and <code>new</code>) can be done either <em>dynamically</em> or <em>statically</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md45"></a>
Dynamic override</h2>
<p>This is the recommended way to override the standard malloc interface.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md46"></a>
Dynamic Override on Linux, BSD</h3>
<p>On these ELF-based systems we preload the mimalloc shared library so all calls to the standard <code>malloc</code> interface are resolved to the <em>mimalloc</em> library. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>You can set extra environment variables to check that mimalloc is running, like: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; env MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> or run with the debug version to get detailed statistics: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; env MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc-debug.so myprogram</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md47"></a>
Dynamic Override on MacOS</h3>
<p>On macOS we can also preload the mimalloc shared library so all calls to the standard <code>malloc</code> interface are resolved to the <em>mimalloc</em> library. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.dylib myprogram</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Note that certain security restrictions may apply when doing this from the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43941322/dyld-insert-libraries-ignored-when-calling-application-through-bash">shell</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md48"></a>
Dynamic Override on Windows</h3>
<p><span id="override_on_windows">We use a separate redirection DLL to override mimalloc on Windows</span> such that we redirect all malloc/free calls that go through the (dynamic) C runtime allocator, including those from other DLL's or libraries. As it intercepts all allocation calls on a low level, it can be used on large programs that include other 3rd party components. There are four requirements to make the overriding work well:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the C-runtime library as a DLL (using the <code>/MD</code> or <code>/MDd</code> switch).</li>
<li>Link your program explicitly with the <code>mimalloc.dll.lib</code> export library for the <code>mimalloc.dll</code>. (which must be compiled with <code>-DMI_OVERRIDE=ON</code>, which is the default though). To ensure the <code>mimalloc.dll</code> is actually loaded at run-time it is easiest to insert some call to the mimalloc API in the <code>main</code> function, like <code><a class="el" href="mimalloc_8h.html#a906d3e6d7f3e9cf284134c7d23d965e7">mi_version()</a></code> (or use the <code>/include:mi_version</code> switch on the linker command, or similarly, <code>#pragma comment(linker, "/include:mi_version")</code> in some source file). See the <code>mimalloc-test-override</code> project for an example on how to use this.</li>
<li>The <code>mimalloc-redirect.dll</code> must be put in the same directory as the main <code>mimalloc.dll</code> at runtime (as it is a dependency of that DLL). The redirection DLL ensures that all calls to the C runtime malloc API get redirected to mimalloc functions (which reside in <code>mimalloc.dll</code>).</li>
<li>Ensure the <code>mimalloc.dll</code> comes as early as possible in the import list of the final executable (so it can intercept all potential allocations). You can use <code>minject -l &lt;exe&gt;</code> to check this if needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For best performance on Windows with C++, it is also recommended to also override the <code>new</code>/<code>delete</code> operations (by including <a href="include/mimalloc-new-delete.h"><code>mimalloc-new-delete.h</code></a> a single(!) source file in your project).</p>
<p>The environment variable <code>MIMALLOC_DISABLE_REDIRECT=1</code> can be used to disable dynamic overriding at run-time. Use <code>MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1</code> to check if mimalloc was successfully redirected.</p>
<p>For different platforms than x64, you may need a specific [redirection dll](bin). Furthermore, we cannot always re-link an executable or ensure <code>mimalloc.dll</code> comes first in the import table. In such cases the [<code>minject</code>](bin) tool can be used to patch the executable's import tables.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md49"></a>
Static override</h2>
<p>On Unix-like systems, you can also statically link with <em>mimalloc</em> to override the standard malloc interface. The recommended way is to link the final program with the <em>mimalloc</em> single object file (<code>mimalloc.o</code>). We use an object file instead of a library file as linkers give preference to that over archives to resolve symbols. To ensure that the standard malloc interface resolves to the <em>mimalloc</em> library, link it as the first object file. For example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; gcc -o myprogram mimalloc.o  myfile1.c ...</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Another way to override statically that works on all platforms, is to link statically to mimalloc (as shown in the introduction) and include a header file in each source file that re-defines <code>malloc</code> etc. to <code>mi_malloc</code>. This is provided by <a href="include/mimalloc-override.h"><code>mimalloc-override.h</code></a>. This only works reliably though if all sources are under your control or otherwise mixing of pointers from different heaps may occur!</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md50"></a>
Tools</h1>
<p>Generally, we recommend using the standard allocator with memory tracking tools, but mimalloc can also be build to support the <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">address sanitizer</a> or the excellent <a href="https://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> tool. Moreover, it can be build to support Windows event tracing (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows">ETW</a>). This has a small performance overhead but does allow detecting memory leaks and byte-precise buffer overflows directly on final executables. See also the <code><a class="el" href="test-wrong_8c.html">test/test-wrong.c</a></code> file to test with various tools.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md51"></a>
Valgrind</h2>
<p>To build with <a href="https://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> support, use the <code>MI_TRACK_VALGRIND=ON</code> cmake option:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; cmake ../.. -DMI_TRACK_VALGRIND=ON</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This can also be combined with secure mode or debug mode. You can then run your programs directly under valgrind:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; valgrind &lt;myprogram&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>If you rely on overriding <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> by mimalloc (instead of using the <code>mi_malloc</code>/<code>mi_free</code> API directly), you also need to tell <code>valgrind</code> to not intercept those calls itself, and use:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 valgrind  --soname-synonyms=somalloc=*mimalloc* -- &lt;myprogram&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>By setting the <code>MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS</code> environment variable you can check that mimalloc is indeed used and not the standard allocator. Even though the <a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#opt.soname-synonyms">Valgrind option</a> is called <code>--soname-synonyms</code>, this also works when overriding with a static library or object file. To dynamically override mimalloc using <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> together with <code>valgrind</code>, use:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; valgrind --trace-children=yes --soname-synonyms=somalloc=*mimalloc* /usr/bin/env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so -- &lt;myprogram&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>See also the <code><a class="el" href="test-wrong_8c.html">test/test-wrong.c</a></code> file to test with <code>valgrind</code>.</p>
<p>Valgrind support is in its initial development &ndash; please report any issues.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md52"></a>
ASAN</h2>
<p>To build with the address sanitizer, use the <code>-DMI_TRACK_ASAN=ON</code> cmake option:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; cmake ../.. -DMI_TRACK_ASAN=ON</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This can also be combined with secure mode or debug mode. You can then run your programs as:'</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ASAN_OPTIONS=verbosity=1 &lt;myprogram&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>When you link a program with an address sanitizer build of mimalloc, you should generally compile that program too with the address sanitizer enabled. For example, assuming you build mimalloc in <code>out/debug</code>:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">clang -g -o test-wrong -Iinclude test/test-wrong.c out/debug/libmimalloc-asan-debug.a -lpthread -fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Since the address sanitizer redirects the standard allocation functions, on some platforms (macOSX for example) it is required to compile mimalloc with <code>-DMI_OVERRIDE=OFF</code>. Address sanitizer support is in its initial development &ndash; please report any issues.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md53"></a>
ETW</h2>
<p>Event tracing for Windows (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows">ETW</a>) provides a high performance way to capture all allocations though mimalloc and analyze them later. To build with ETW support, use the <code>-DMI_TRACK_ETW=ON</code> cmake option.</p>
<p>You can then capture an allocation trace using the Windows performance recorder (WPR), using the <code>src/prim/windows/etw-mimalloc.wprp</code> profile. In an admin prompt, you can use: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; wpr -start src\prim\windows\etw-mimalloc.wprp -filemode</div>
<div class="line">&gt; &lt;my_mimalloc_program&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&gt; wpr -stop &lt;my_mimalloc_program&gt;.etl</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> and then open <code>&lt;my_mimalloc_program&gt;.etl</code> in the Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), or use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/xinglonghe/TraceControl">TraceControl</a> that is specialized for analyzing mimalloc traces.</p>

Performance</h1>
<p>Last update: 2021-01-30</p>
<p>We tested <em>mimalloc</em> against many other top allocators over a wide range of benchmarks, ranging from various real world programs to synthetic benchmarks that see how the allocator behaves under more extreme circumstances. In our benchmark suite, <em>mimalloc</em> outperforms other leading allocators (<em>jemalloc</em>, <em>tcmalloc</em>, <em>Hoard</em>, etc), and has a similar memory footprint. A nice property is that it does consistently well over the wide range of benchmarks.</p>
<p>General memory allocators are interesting as there exists no algorithm that is optimal &ndash; for a given allocator one can usually construct a workload where it does not do so well. The goal is thus to find an allocation strategy that performs well over a wide range of benchmarks without suffering from (too much) underperformance in less common situations.</p>
<p>As always, interpret these results with care since some benchmarks test synthetic or uncommon situations that may never apply to your workloads. For example, most allocators do not do well on <code>xmalloc-testN</code> but that includes even the best industrial allocators like <em>jemalloc</em> and <em>tcmalloc</em> that are used in some of the world's largest systems (like Chrome or FreeBSD).</p>
<p>Also, the benchmarks here do not measure the behaviour on very large and long-running server workloads, or worst-case latencies of allocation. Much work has gone into <code>mimalloc</code> to work well on such workloads (for example, to reduce virtual memory fragmentation on long-running services) but such optimizations are not always reflected in the current benchmark suite.</p>
<p>We show here only an overview &ndash; for more specific details and further benchmarks we refer to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mimalloc-free-list-sharding-in-action">technical report</a>. The benchmark suite is automated and available separately as <a href="https://github.com/daanx/mimalloc-bench">mimalloc-bench</a>.</p>

<p>Testing on the 16-core AMD 5950x processor at 3.4Ghz (4.9Ghz boost), with with 32GiB memory at 3600Mhz, running Ubuntu 20.04 with glibc 2.31 and GCC 9.3.0.</p>
<p>We measure three versions of <em>mimalloc</em>: the main version <code>mi</code> (tag:v1.7.0), the new v2.0 beta version as <code>xmi</code> (tag:v2.0.0), and the main version in secure mode as <code>smi</code> (tag:v1.7.0).</p>
<p>The other allocators are Google's <a href="https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools"><em>tcmalloc</em></a> (<code>tc</code>, tag:gperftools-2.8.1) used in Chrome, Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc"><em>jemalloc</em></a> (<code>je</code>, tag:5.2.1) by Jason Evans used in Firefox and FreeBSD, the Intel thread building blocks <a href="https://github.com/intel/tbb">allocator</a> (<code>tbb</code>, tag:v2020.3), <a href="https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc">rpmalloc</a> (<code>rp</code>,tag:1.4.1) by Mattias Jansson, the original scalable <a href="https://github.com/emeryberger/Hoard"><em>Hoard</em></a> (git:d880f72) allocator by Emery Berger [1], the memory compacting <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/Mesh"><em>Mesh</em></a> (git:67ff31a) allocator by Bobby Powers <em>et al</em> [8], and finally the default system allocator (<code>glibc</code>, 2.31) (based on <em>PtMalloc2</em>).</p>

<p>Any benchmarks ending in <code>N</code> run on all 32 logical cores in parallel. Results are averaged over 10 runs and reported relative to mimalloc (where 1.2 means it took 1.2&times; longer to run). The legend also contains the <em>overall relative score</em> between the allocators where 100 points is the maximum if an allocator is fastest on all benchmarks.</p>
<p>The single threaded <em>cfrac</em> benchmark by Dave Barrett is an implementation of continued fraction factorization which uses many small short-lived allocations. All allocators do well on such common usage, where <em>mimalloc</em> is just a tad faster than <em>tcmalloc</em> and <em>jemalloc</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>leanN</em> program is interesting as a large realistic and concurrent workload of the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean">Lean</a> theorem prover compiling its own standard library, and there is a 13% speedup over <em>tcmalloc</em>. This is quite significant: if Lean spends 20% of its time in the allocator that means that <em>mimalloc</em> is 1.6&times; faster than <em>tcmalloc</em> here. (This is surprising as that is not measured in a pure allocation benchmark like <em>alloc-test</em>. We conjecture that we see this outsized improvement here because <em>mimalloc</em> has better locality in the allocation which improves performance for the <em>other</em> computations in a program as well).</p>
<p>The single threaded <em>redis</em> benchmark again show that most allocators do well on such workloads.</p>
<p>The <em>larsonN</em> server benchmark by Larson and Krishnan [2] allocates and frees between threads. They observed this behavior (which they call <em>bleeding</em>) in actual server applications, and the benchmark simulates this. Here, <em>mimalloc</em> is quite a bit faster than <em>tcmalloc</em> and <em>jemalloc</em> probably due to the object migration between different threads.</p>
<p>The <em>mstressN</em> workload performs many allocations and re-allocations, and migrates objects between threads (as in <em>larsonN</em>). However, it also creates and destroys the <em>N</em> worker threads a few times keeping some objects alive beyond the life time of the allocating thread. We observed this behavior in many larger server applications.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc-benchmark"><em>rptestN</em></a> benchmark by Mattias Jansson is a allocator test originally designed for <em>rpmalloc</em>, and tries to simulate realistic allocation patterns over multiple threads. Here the differences between allocators become more apparent.</p>
<p>The second benchmark set tests specific aspects of the allocators and shows even more extreme differences between them.</p>
<p>The <em>alloc-test</em>, by <a href="http://ithare.com/testing-memory-allocators-ptmalloc2-tcmalloc-hoard-jemalloc-while-trying-to-simulate-real-world-loads/">OLogN Technologies AG</a>, is a very allocation intensive benchmark doing millions of allocations in various size classes. The test is scaled such that when an allocator performs almost identically on <em>alloc-test1</em> as <em>alloc-testN</em> it means that it scales linearly.</p>
<p>The <em>sh6bench</em> and <em>sh8bench</em> benchmarks are developed by <a href="http://www.microquill.com/">MicroQuill</a> as part of SmartHeap. In <em>sh6bench</em> <em>mimalloc</em> does much better than the others (more than 2.5&times; faster than <em>jemalloc</em>). We cannot explain this well but believe it is caused in part by the "reverse" free-ing pattern in <em>sh6bench</em>. The <em>sh8bench</em> is a variation with object migration between threads; whereas <em>tcmalloc</em> did well on <em>sh6bench</em>, the addition of object migration causes it to be 10&times; slower than before.</p>
<p>The <em>xmalloc-testN</em> benchmark by Lever and Boreham [5] and Christian Eder, simulates an asymmetric workload where some threads only allocate, and others only free &ndash; they observed this pattern in larger server applications. Here we see that the <em>mimalloc</em> technique of having non-contended sharded thread free lists pays off as it outperforms others by a very large margin. Only <em>rpmalloc</em>, <em>tbb</em>, and <em>glibc</em> also scale well on this benchmark.</p>
<p>The <em>cache-scratch</em> benchmark by Emery Berger [1], and introduced with the Hoard allocator to test for <em>passive-false</em> sharing of cache lines. With a single thread they all perform the same, but when running with multiple threads the potential allocator induced false sharing of the cache lines can cause large run-time differences. Crundal [6] describes in detail why the false cache line sharing occurs in the <em>tcmalloc</em> design, and also discusses how this can be avoided with some small implementation changes. Only the <em>tbb</em>, <em>rpmalloc</em> and <em>mesh</em> allocators also avoid the cache line sharing completely, while <em>Hoard</em> and <em>glibc</em> seem to mitigate the effects. Kukanov and Voss [7] describe in detail how the design of <em>tbb</em> avoids the false cache line sharing.</p>

On a 36-core Intel Xeon</h2>
<p>For completeness, here are the results on a big Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized">c5.18xlarge</a> instance consisting of a 2&times;18-core Intel Xeon (Cascade Lake) at 3.4GHz (boost 3.5GHz) with 144GiB ECC memory, running Ubuntu 20.04 with glibc 2.31, GCC 9.3.0, and Clang 10.0.0. This time, the mimalloc allocators (mi, xmi, and smi) were compiled with the Clang compiler instead of GCC. The results are similar to the AMD results but it is interesting to see the differences in the <em>larsonN</em>, <em>mstressN</em>, and <em>xmalloc-testN</em> benchmarks.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md57"></a>
Peak Working Set</h2>
<p>The following figure shows the peak working set (rss) of the allocators on the benchmarks (on the c5.18xlarge instance).</p>
<p><img src="doc/bench-2021/bench-c5-18xlarge-2021-01-30-rss-a.svg" alt="" width="90%" style="pointer-events: none;" class="inline"/> <img src="doc/bench-2021/bench-c5-18xlarge-2021-01-30-rss-b.svg" alt="" width="90%" style="pointer-events: none;" class="inline"/></p>
<p>Note that the <em>xmalloc-testN</em> memory usage should be disregarded as it allocates more the faster the program runs. Similarly, memory usage of <em>larsonN</em>, <em>mstressN</em>, <em>rptestN</em> and <em>sh8bench</em> can vary depending on scheduling and speed. Nevertheless, we hope to improve the memory usage on <em>mstressN</em> and <em>rptestN</em> (just as <em>cfrac</em>, <em>larsonN</em> and <em>sh8bench</em> have a small working set which skews the results).</p>
