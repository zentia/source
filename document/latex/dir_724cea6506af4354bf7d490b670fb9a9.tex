\doxysubsection{详细描述}
This experimental plugin provides integration of Addressables on-\/demand texture loading for the spine-\/unity runtime. Please be sure to test this package first and create backups of your project before using.

The \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Addressables Extension module covers all necessary steps to automatically replace your textures with low-\/resolution placeholder textures and loading the high-\/resolution textures upon request. The textures are automatically replaced with the low-\/resolution texture when building your game executable via a pre-\/build step (and reset to the high-\/resolution textures afterwards in the post-\/build step). There is no additional coding required.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1127}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1127}
The following steps are all that is required to setup your textures to be replaced with low resolution placeholders and downloaded on-\/demand\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Declare your original high-\/resolution target Material textures as \href{https://learn.unity.com/course/get-started-with-addressables}{\texttt{ addressable}}.
\item Select the {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset}, right-\/click the {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset} Inspector heading and select {\ttfamily Add Addressables Loader}. This generates an {\ttfamily Addressable\+Texture\+Loader} asset. This asset provides configuration parameters and sets up low-\/resolution placeholder textures which are automatically assigned in a pre-\/build step when building your game executable.
\item Build your Addressables content as usual.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

From now on when building your game executable, the low resolution placeholder textures are automatically assigned initially and the corresponding high-\/resolution textures loaded on-\/demand.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1128}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Editor Preview}{Editor Preview}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1128}
Please note that the low-\/resolution textures are activated only when building the game executable, they are usually never shown in the Editor, also not in play-\/mode.

If you still want to temporarily assign the low-\/resolution placeholder textures for preview purposes, select the desired {\ttfamily Addressable\+Texture\+Loader} asset and hit {\ttfamily Testing} -\/ {\ttfamily Assign Placeholders} to temporarily replace the high-\/resolution textures with their low-\/resolution placeholders. You can then see the high-\/resolution textures loaded on-\/demand when entering play-\/mode. Note that this is for preview purposes only and has no effect on the built game executable.

Placeholder textures need not be assigned manually, as these are automatically assigned via a pre-\/build step (and reset afterwards in the post-\/build step).
