Prior to being open-\/source in 2018, Cpp-\/\+Taskflow was internal to the @\+Open\+Timer\+Git\+Hub project sponsored by the NSF and DARPA. Later, we decided to open our knowledge of parallelizing large-\/scale parallel applications by making Cpp-\/\+Taskflow a standalone open-\/source project that can benefit generic C++ developers.

Due to the difference license agreement imposed by Open\+Timer at an earlier stage (i.\+e., users and funding agency requirement), we are unable to open the source of Cpp-\/\+Taskflow in the 1.\+x line. Starting from 2.\+x, we have switched to MIT license and made the source completely open and transparent to the community.
