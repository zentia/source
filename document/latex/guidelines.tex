Visit the @\+Project\+Website and get an 1000-\/feet overview of Taskflow, in which you shall find recent news, releases, use cases, and other useful information of Taskflow. We also provided a @\+Showcase\+Presentation for you to quickly understand the technical work of Taskflow. Then, check out our \doxysectlink{usecases}{Real Use Cases}{0} and get a sense about the problems Taskflow is good at.\hypertarget{guidelines_Step2WriteATaskflowProgram}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Step 2\+: Write a Taskflow program}{Step 2\+: Write a Taskflow program}}\label{guidelines_Step2WriteATaskflowProgram}
Taskflow is a programming system. We believe it is impossible to understand what Taskflow is doing without writing real code. Visit the quick-\/start page and program your first hello-\/world with Taskflow!

The hello-\/world program creates four tasks, {\ttfamily \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A}}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_a37a83060ac796961b44991c836f083f7}{B}}, {\ttfamily C}, and {\ttfamily D}, where {\ttfamily \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A}} runs before {\ttfamily \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_a37a83060ac796961b44991c836f083f7}{B}} and {\ttfamily C}, and {\ttfamily D} runs after {\ttfamily \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_a37a83060ac796961b44991c836f083f7}{B}} and {\ttfamily C}. When {\ttfamily \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A}} finishes, {\ttfamily \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_a37a83060ac796961b44991c836f083f7}{B}} and {\ttfamily C} can run in parallel, and then {\ttfamily D}.\hypertarget{guidelines_Step3WriteATaskflowProgram}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Step 3\+: Dive in}{Step 3\+: Dive in}}\label{guidelines_Step3WriteATaskflowProgram}
After you successfully finish the hello-\/world example, give a deep dive-\/in to the technical details by visiting \doxysectlink{_cookbook}{Cookbook}{0}, \doxysectlink{_algorithms}{Taskflow Algorithms}{0}, and \doxysectlink{_examples}{Learning from Examples}{0}. These pages provides you step-\/by-\/step tutorials about the fundamental syntaxes and tasking models in Taskflow that you need to fully take advantage of task graph parallelism to boost your application performance.

At this stage, you may encounter issues, features requests, and questions. Then, start your first contribution by posting them in our @\+Issue\+Tracker!\hypertarget{guidelines_HowCanIReportAnIssue}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How Can I Report Issues?}{How Can I Report Issues?}}\label{guidelines_HowCanIReportAnIssue}
Taskflow is in active development. We are not surprised that you encounter something that needs improvement or fixes to work for your use cases. Or you want to suggest something that can improve Taskflow\textquotesingle{}s functionality. Please do not hesitate to share any of these issues with by by opening an post at our @\+Issue\+Tracker!

Please make sure that you provide all the necessary information in the issue body to communicate your problem clearly so we can work on it efficiently.\hypertarget{guidelines_HowCanIEditTheDocumentation}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How Can I Edit the Documentation?}{How Can I Edit the Documentation?}}\label{guidelines_HowCanIEditTheDocumentation}
Documentation is just as important as the codebase! There is always a scope of improvement in documentation to add some missing information or to make it easier to read. We use the famous \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html}{\texttt{ Doxygen}} to compile our documentation. You can edit the \href{https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow/tree/master/doxygen}{\texttt{ documentation source}} which is stored as a text file in the {\ttfamily doxygen} directory of Taskflow. After editing the file locally, you can submit your changes to us by making a patch.\hypertarget{guidelines_HowCanISubmitAPatch}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How Can I Submit a Patch?}{How Can I Submit a Patch?}}\label{guidelines_HowCanISubmitAPatch}
To contribute your code to Taskflow, you need to make a @\+Pull\+Request from your \href{https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow/network/members}{\texttt{ fork of Taskflow}}. Git\+Hub makes the development flow of \href{https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/about-pull-requests}{\texttt{ submitting pull requests}} extremely handy as long as you follow the standard fork process.

When you make a pull request, please provide all the necessary information requested by prompts in the pull request body. In addition, make sure the code you are submitting always accounts for the following three guidelines\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\doxylink{struct_run}{Run} the tests\+:}} You must pass through our unit tests (see \doxysectlink{install}{Building and Installing}{0}) before submitting the pull request. Our unit tests have accumulated many corner cases over the past years that can detect defects in the newly developed features or bugs when changing the existing functionality.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Profile the change\+:}} You must inspect any performance hit caused by your changes. There are multiple ways to profile Taskflow but we recommend you try to record the runtime of completing all unit tests {\itshape before} and {\itshape after} your changes.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Document the code\+:}} You must document the code or provide a clear explanation about your pull request. You may also provide \href{https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow/tree/master/examples}{\texttt{ examples}} specific to your new changes and include them in our cmake script.\end{DoxyItemize}
Please let us know all people who are involved in the pull request so that we can appropriately acknowledge everyone\textquotesingle{}s effort at the \doxylink{contributors}{Contributors} page. If there are any issues that you would like to communicate offline, please @\+Contact\+Us.\hypertarget{guidelines_HowCanILeadAProject}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How Can I Lead a Project?}{How Can I Lead a Project?}}\label{guidelines_HowCanILeadAProject}
There are many on-\/going and future projects that interest us and the Taskflow community. Given the tremendous amount of work, we welcome organizations or individuals to take lead on these projects. The table below summarizes a list of projects that need you to either take lead or contribute\+:
