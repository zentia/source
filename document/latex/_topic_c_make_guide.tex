Eigen provides native CMake support which allows the library to be easily used in CMake projects.

\begin{DoxyNote}{注解}
CMake 3.\+0 (or later) is required to enable this functionality.
\end{DoxyNote}
Eigen exports a CMake target called {\ttfamily Eigen3\+::\+Eigen} which can be imported using the {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package} CMake command and used by calling {\ttfamily target\+\_\+link\+\_\+libraries} as in the following example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\_minimum\_required\ (VERSION\ 3.0)}
\DoxyCodeLine{project\ (myproject)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package\ (Eigen3\ 3.3\ REQUIRED\ NO\_MODULE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_executable\ (example\ example.cpp)}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries\ (example\ Eigen3::Eigen)}

\end{DoxyCode}


The above code snippet must be placed in a file called {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} alongside {\ttfamily example.\+cpp}. After running 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ cmake\ path-\/to-\/example-\/directory}

\end{DoxyCode}
 CMake will produce project files that generate an executable called {\ttfamily example} which requires at least version 3.\+3 of Eigen. Here, {\ttfamily path-\/to-\/example-\/directory} is the path to the directory that contains both {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} and {\ttfamily example.\+cpp}.

If you have multiple installed version of Eigen, you can pick your favorite one by setting the {\ttfamily Eigen3\+\_\+\+DIR} cmake\textquotesingle{}s variable to the respective path containing the {\ttfamily Eigen3\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}}.cmake files. For instance\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{cblat2_8f_a02c505d1046fe3c18a9f17c1f1dc6b51}{cmake}}\ \mbox{\hyperlink{ittnotify__static_8h_a7016119bc831a22d1a351d56128518ed}{path}}-\/to-\/example-\/directory\ -\/DEigen3\_DIR=\$HOME/mypackages/share/eigen3/\mbox{\hyperlink{cblat2_8f_a02c505d1046fe3c18a9f17c1f1dc6b51}{cmake}}/}

\end{DoxyCode}


If the {\ttfamily REQUIRED} option is omitted when locating Eigen using {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package}, one can check whether the package was found as follows\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package\ (Eigen3\ 3.3\ NO\_MODULE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{if\ (TARGET\ Eigen3::Eigen)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \#\ Use\ the\ imported\ target}
\DoxyCodeLine{endif\ (TARGET\ Eigen3::Eigen)}

\end{DoxyCode}
