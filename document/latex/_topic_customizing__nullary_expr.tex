The main purpose of the class \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_cwise_nullary_op}{Cwise\+Nullary\+Op} is to define {\itshape procedural} matrices such as constant or random matrices as returned by the Ones(), Zero(), Constant(), Identity() and Random() methods. Nevertheless, with some imagination it is possible to accomplish very sophisticated matrix manipulation with minimal efforts such that \doxylink{TopicNewExpressionType}{implementing new expression} is rarely needed.\hypertarget{_topic_customizing__nullary_expr_NullaryExpr_Circulant}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example 1\+: circulant matrix}{Example 1\+: circulant matrix}}\label{_topic_customizing__nullary_expr_NullaryExpr_Circulant}
To explore these possibilities let us start with the {\itshape circulant} example of the \doxylink{TopicNewExpressionType}{implementing new expression} topic. Let us recall that a circulant matrix is a matrix where each column is the same as the column to the left, except that it is cyclically shifted downwards. For example, here is a 4-\/by-\/4 circulant matrix\+:      \[ \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 8 & 4 & 2 \\
    2 & 1 & 8 & 4 \\
    4 & 2 & 1 & 8 \\
    8 & 4 & 2 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \] \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A} circulant matrix is uniquely determined by its first column. We wish to write a function {\ttfamily make\+Circulant} which, given the first column, returns an expression representing the circulant matrix.

For this exercise, the return type of {\ttfamily make\+Circulant} will be a \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_cwise_nullary_op}{Cwise\+Nullary\+Op} that we need to instantiate with\+: 1 -\/ a proper {\ttfamily \doxylink{classcirculant__functor}{circulant\+\_\+functor}} storing the input vector and implementing the adequate coefficient accessor {\ttfamily operator(i,j)} 2 -\/ a template instantiation of class \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix}{Matrix} conveying compile-\/time information such as the scalar type, sizes, and preferred storage layout.

Calling {\ttfamily Arg\+Type} the type of the input vector, we can construct the equivalent squared \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix}{Matrix} type as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


This little helper structure will help us to implement our {\ttfamily make\+Circulant} function as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


As usual, our function takes as argument a {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix_base}{Matrix\+Base}} (see this \doxylink{TopicFunctionTakingEigenTypes}{page} for more details). Then, the \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_cwise_nullary_op}{Cwise\+Nullary\+Op} object is constructed through the \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_dense_base_abc23946998f7e9b424a9690100d81505}{Dense\+Base\+::\+Nullary\+Expr} static method with the adequate runtime sizes.

Then, we need to implement our {\ttfamily \doxylink{classcirculant__functor}{circulant\+\_\+functor}}, which is a straightforward exercise\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


We are now all set to try our new feature\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


If all the fragments are combined, the following output is produced, showing that the program works as expected\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


This implementation of {\ttfamily make\+Circulant} is much simpler than \doxylink{TopicNewExpressionType}{defining a new expression} from scratch.\hypertarget{_topic_customizing__nullary_expr_NullaryExpr_Indexing}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example 2\+: indexing rows and columns}{Example 2\+: indexing rows and columns}}\label{_topic_customizing__nullary_expr_NullaryExpr_Indexing}
The goal here is to mimic Mat\+Lab\textquotesingle{}s ability to index a matrix through two vectors of indices referencing the rows and columns to be picked respectively, like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


To this end, let us first write a nullary-\/functor storing references to the input matrix and to the two arrays of indices, and implementing the required {\ttfamily operator()(i,j)}\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


Then, let\textquotesingle{}s create an {\ttfamily indexing(\+A,rows,cols)} function creating the nullary expression\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


Finally, here is an example of how this function can be used\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


This straightforward implementation is already quite powerful as the row or column index arrays can also be expressions to perform offsetting, modulo, striding, reverse, etc.


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


and the output is\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
