\doxysubsection{详细描述}
The spine-\/flutter runtime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render \href{https://esotericsoftware.com}{\texttt{ Spine}} skeletal animation data using \href{https://flutter.dev/}{\texttt{ Flutter}}. spine-\/flutter is based on \href{../spine-cpp}{\texttt{ spine-\/cpp}} and supports desktop and mobile Flutter deployment targets. spine-\/flutter does not support Flutter\textquotesingle{}s web deployment target.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1017}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{See the \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-flutter}{\texttt{ spine-\/flutter documentation}} for in-\/depth information.}{See the \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-flutter}{\texttt{ spine-\/flutter documentation}} for in-\/depth information.}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1017}
The {\ttfamily spine\+\_\+flutter} package name was previously used to publish the \href{https://github.com/jtakakura/spine_flutter/}{\texttt{ Spine Flutter Runtime in plain Dart}} by Junji Takakura. Junji has kindly transferred the package name to us and is now publishing his Dart-\/only \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Flutter Runtime under the package name \href{https://pub.dev/packages/spine_flutter_dart}{\texttt{ spine\+\_\+flutter\+\_\+dart}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1018}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Licensing}{Licensing}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1018}
You are welcome to evaluate the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Runtimes and the examples we provide in this repository free of charge.

You can integrate the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Runtimes into your software free of charge, but users of your software must have their own \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase}{\texttt{ Spine license}}. Please make your users aware of this requirement! This option is often chosen by those making development tools, such as an SDK, game toolkit, or software library.

In order to distribute your software containing the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Runtimes to others that don\textquotesingle{}t have a \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} license, you need a \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase}{\texttt{ Spine license}} at the time of integration. Then you can distribute your software containing the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Runtimes however you like, provided others don\textquotesingle{}t modify it or use it to create new software. If others want to do that, they\textquotesingle{}ll need their own \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} license.

For the official legal terms governing the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Runtimes, please read the \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes-license}{\texttt{ Spine Runtimes License Agreement}} and Section 2 of the \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-editor-license\#s2}{\texttt{ Spine Editor License Agreement}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1019}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Spine version}{Spine version}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1019}
spine-\/flutter works with data exported from \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} 4.\+2.\+xx.

spine-\/flutter supports all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} features, except two-\/color tinting and the screen blend mode.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1020}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Supported platforms}{Supported platforms}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1020}
The spine-\/flutter runtime works on desktop, mobile and web. Web deployment requires canvaskit, which will add about 2mb of dependencies to your web deployment. You can compile your app for web with Canvaskit like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{flutter\ build\ web\ -\/-\/web-\/renderer\ canvaskit}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1021}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Setup}{Setup}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1021}
To add {\ttfamily spine\+\_\+flutter} to your Flutter project, add the following dependency to your {\ttfamily pubspec.\+yaml} file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{dependencies:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ spine\_flutter:\ \string^4.2.11}

\end{DoxyCode}


In your {\ttfamily \doxylink{main-override-static_8c_ae66f6b31b5ad750f1fe042a706a4e3d4}{main()}}, add these two lines in the beginning to initialize the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Flutter runtime\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{void\ main()\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ await\ initSpineFlutter(enableMemoryDebugging:\ false);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1022}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example}{Example}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1022}
If you have pulled the {\ttfamily spine\+\_\+flutter} package from \href{https://pub.dev}{\texttt{ pub.\+dev}} directly, you can run the example in the {\ttfamily example/} folder as is\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd\ path/to/downloaded/spine\_flutter}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd\ example}
\DoxyCodeLine{flutter\ run}

\end{DoxyCode}


Otherwise you can run the example like this\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item install the \href{https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install}{\texttt{ Flutter SDK}}, then run {\ttfamily flutter doctor} which will instruct you what other dependencies to install.
\item Clone this repository {\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/esotericsoftware/spine-runtimes}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/esotericsoftware/spine-\/runtimes}}}
\item \doxylink{struct_run}{Run} {\ttfamily setup.\+sh} in the {\ttfamily spine-\/flutter/} folder. On Windows, you can use \href{https://gitforwindows.org/}{\texttt{ Git Bash}} included in Git for Window to run the {\ttfamily setup.\+sh} Bash script.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

You can then open {\ttfamily spine-\/flutter} in an IDE or editor of your choice that supports Flutter, like \href{https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio}{\texttt{ IntelliJ IDEA/\+Android Studio}} or \href{https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode}{\texttt{ Visual Studio Code}} to inspect and run the example.

Alternatively, you can run the example from the \href{https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal}{\texttt{ command line}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1023}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Development}{Development}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1023}
If all you modify are the Dart sources of the plugin, then the development setup is the same as the setup described under "{}\+Example"{} above.

If you need to work on the {\ttfamily dart\+:ffi} bindings for {\ttfamily spine-\/cpp}, you will also need to install \href{https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html}{\texttt{ Emscripten}}.

To generate the bindings based on the {\ttfamily src/spine\+\_\+flutter.\+h} header, run {\ttfamily dart run ffigen -\/-\/config ffigen.\+yaml}. After the bindings have been generated, you must replace the line `import \textquotesingle{}dart\+:ffi' as ffi;{\ttfamily with}import \textquotesingle{}ffi\+\_\+proxy.\+dart\textquotesingle{} as ffi;{\ttfamily in the file}src/spine\+\_\+flutter\+\_\+bindings\+\_\+generated.\+dart\`{}. Otherwise the bindings will not compile for the web.

If you made changes to {\ttfamily spine-\/cpp} or the source files in {\ttfamily src/}, you must run {\ttfamily compile-\/wasm.\+sh}. This will compile {\ttfamily spine-\/cpp} and the bindings for the Web and place updated versions of {\ttfamily libspine\+\_\+flutter.\+js} and {\ttfamily libspine\+\_\+flutter.\+wasm} in the {\ttfamily lib/assets/} folder. For web builds, the {\ttfamily init\+Spine\+Flutter\+FFI()} function in {\ttfamily lib/init\+\_\+web.\+dart} will load these files from the package\textquotesingle{}s asset bundle.
