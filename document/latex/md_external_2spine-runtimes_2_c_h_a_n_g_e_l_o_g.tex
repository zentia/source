\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-api-reference\#TrackEntry-alphaAttachmentThreshold}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Track\+Entry.\+Alpha\+Attachment\+Threshold}}}.

\item Changed signature of {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+Update\+World\+Transform()} to {\ttfamily Update\+World\+Transform(Skeleton.\+Physics physics)}. The default replacement for {\ttfamily skeleton.\+Update\+World\+Transform()} calls is {\ttfamily skeleton.\+Update\+World\+Transform(Skeleton.\+Physics.\+Update)}. If you are certain that a subsequent call to {\ttfamily skeleton.\+Update\+World\+Transform(Skeleton.\+Physics.\+Update)} follows in the same frame, you can pass {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+Physics.\+Pose} as argument instead of {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+Physics.\+Update}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Officially supported Unity versions are 2017.\+1-\/6000.\+0}}.
\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily On\+Post\+Process\+Vertices} callback parameter {\ttfamily Mesh\+Generator\+Buffers} now provides access to {\ttfamily uv2\+Buffer} and {\ttfamily uv3\+Buffer} properties of {\ttfamily Mesh\+Generator}, automatically allocating buffers upon access if {\ttfamily tint\+Black} is disabled. This allows for passing own vertex data to a shader on second and third uv channels.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Grayscale} shader to provide a basic grayscale shader for Skeleton\+Graphic as well. Skeleton\+Graphic Material {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Default\+Grayscale} uses this shader and can be assigned at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} components as usual.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now supports automatic scaling based on its {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} bounds. Automatic scaling can be enabled by setting the added {\ttfamily Layout Scale \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} Inspector property to either {\ttfamily Width Controls Height}, {\ttfamily Height Controls Width}, {\ttfamily Fit\+In\+Parent} or {\ttfamily Envelope\+Parent}. It is set to {\ttfamily None} by default to keep previous behaviour and avoid breaking existing projects. To modify the reference layout bounds, hit the additional {\ttfamily Edit Layout Bounds} toggle button to switch into edit mode, adjust the bounds or hit {\ttfamily Match Rect\+Transform with Mesh}, and hit the button again when done adjusting. The skeleton will now be scaled accordingly to fit the reference layout bounds to the object\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform}.
\item Added previously missing unlit URP 2D shader variant, available under {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Skeleton}.
\item Added support for light cookies at {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Sprite} shader.
\item Timeline extension package\+: An additional \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} preferences parameter {\ttfamily Timeline} -\/ {\ttfamily Default Mix Duration} has been added, setting newly added {\ttfamily Spine\+Animation\+State\+Clip} clips accordingly, defaults to false. This \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} preferences parameter can be enabled to default to the previous behaviour before this update.
\item Tint Black\+: Added support for \href{http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-slots\#Tint-black}{\texttt{ Tint Black}} functionality at all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP shaders (2D and 3D shaders) and at all standard pipeline {\ttfamily Spine/\+Sprite} shaders. This feature can be enabled via the {\ttfamily Tint Black} material parameter in the Inspector. Note\+: The URP Sprite shaders provided in the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP Shaders extension UPM package require the latest version of the spine-\/unity runtime (package version 4.\+1.\+12, 2023-\/05-\/31 or newer) to display the added material parameters in the Inspector GUI.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+Mesh\+Scale} property to allow access to calculated mesh scale. {\ttfamily Mesh\+Scale} is based on (1) Canvas pixels per unit, and (2) {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} bounds when using {\ttfamily Layout Scale \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} other than {\ttfamily None} at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} which scales the skeleton mesh to fit the parent {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} bounds accordingly.
\item Added {\ttfamily update\+Separator\+Part\+Scale} property to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} to let render separator parts follow the scale (lossy scale) of the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Game\+Object. Defaults to {\ttfamily false} to maintain existing behaviour.
\item Added experimental {\ttfamily Editor\+Skeleton\+Player} component to allow Editor playback of the initial animation set at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} components. Add this component to your skeleton Game\+Object to enable the in-\/editor animation preview. Allows configurations for continuous playback when selected, deselected, and alternative single-\/frame preview by setting {\ttfamily Fixed Track Time} to any value other than 0. Limitations\+: At skeletons with variable material count the Inspector preview may be too unresponsive. It is then recommended to disable the {\ttfamily Editor\+Skeleton\+Player} component (at the top of the Inspector) to make it responsive again, then you can disable {\ttfamily Play When Selected} and re-\/enable the component to preview playback only when deselected.
\item Added example component {\ttfamily Render\+Combined\+Mesh} to render a combined mesh of multiple meshes or submeshes. This is required by {\ttfamily Outline\+Only} shaders to render a combined outline when using {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} or multiple atlas pages which would normally lead to outlines around individual parts. To add a combined outline to your Skeleten\+Renderer\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add a child Game\+Object and move it a bit back (e.\+g. position Z = 0.\+01).
\item Add a {\ttfamily Render\+Combined\+Mesh} component, provided in the {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Scripts/\+Sample Components} directory.
\item Copy the original material, add \+\_\+\+\_\+\+Outline\+\_\+ to its name and set the shader to your outline-\/only shader like {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Outline/\+Skeleton-\/\+Outline\+Only} or {\ttfamily Spine/\+Outline/\+Outline\+Only-\/\+ZWrite}.
\item Assign this \+\_\+\+\_\+\+Outline\+\_\+ material at the new child Game\+Object\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Mesh\+Renderer} component. If you are using {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} and need to enable and disable the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} component at runtime, you can increase the {\ttfamily Render\+Combined\+Mesh} {\ttfamily Reference Renderers} array by one and assign the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} itself at the last entry after the parts renderers. Disabled {\ttfamily Mesh\+Renderer} components will be skipped when combining the final mesh, so the combined mesh is automatically filled from the desired active renderers.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Timeline extension package\+: Added static {\ttfamily Editor\+Event} callback to allow editor scripts to react to animation events outside of play-\/mode. Register to the events via {\ttfamily Spine.\+Unity.\+Playables.\+Spine\+Animation\+State\+Mixer\+Behaviour.\+Editor\+Event += Your\+Callback;}.
\item URP Shaders\+: Added {\ttfamily Depth Write} property to shaders {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton} and {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}. Defaults to false to maintain existing behaviour.
\item Added {\ttfamily Animation Update} mode (called {\ttfamily Update\+Timing} in code) {\ttfamily In Late Update} for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}. This allows you to update the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} skeleton in the same frame that the Mecanim Animator updated its state, which happens between {\ttfamily Update} and {\ttfamily Late\+Update}.
\item URP Shaders\+: Added URP "{}\+Blend Mode"{} shader variants for both URP 3D and URP 2D renderers. They are listed under shader name "{}\+Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Blend Modes/"{} and "{}\+Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Blend Modes/"{} respectively.
\item URP Shaders\+: Added support for \href{http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-slots\#Tint-black}{\texttt{ Tint Black}} functionality at "{}\+Blend Modes"{} \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP shaders (2D and 3D shaders).
\item Physics\+Constraints\+: Skeleton Game\+Objects now automatically apply Transform translation and rotation to the skeleton\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Physics\+Constraints}. You can disable applying translation or rotation at the Skeleton component Inspector under {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Physics Inheritance} by setting {\ttfamily Position} to (0,0)and {\ttfamily Rotation} to 0, or by setting the properties {\ttfamily physics\+Position\+Inheritance\+Factor} to {\ttfamily Vector2.\+zero} and {\ttfamily physics\+Rotation\+Inheritance\+Factor} to {\ttfamily 0} at the skeleton component via code.
\item Added {\ttfamily Physics Constraints} example scene (located in {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Other Examples}) together with {\ttfamily celestial-\/circus} example skeleton assets. This scene demonstrates Transform movement automatically affecting physics constraints of a skeleton.
\item Physics\+Constraints\+: Skeleton components now allow you to use relative instead of world-\/space Transform movement by assigning a Transform (typically the parent) to the new {\ttfamily Movement relative to} property. Leave this property at {\ttfamily null} (the default) to use world-\/space Transform movement for physics.
\item Physics\+Constraints\+: Added \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences settings {\ttfamily Editor Instantiation} -\/ {\ttfamily Physics Inheritance} -\/ {\ttfamily Default Position} and {\ttfamily Default Rotation} to initialize skeletons physics settings with the desired Transform position and rotation inheritance factors when added to a scene via drag-\/and-\/drop.
\item Skeleton\+Graphic\+: Added Tint Black blend mode shaders {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black Additive}, {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black Multiply} and {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black Screen}.
\item Skeleton\+Graphic\+: Added pre-\/defined Skeleton\+Graphic material sets for main workflow parameters in folders {\ttfamily spine-\/unity/\+Materials} instead of requiring manual copies\+: {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic-\/\+PMATexture} containing materials for premultiplied-\/alpha texture workflow ({\ttfamily Straight Alpha Texture} disabled) and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic-\/\+Staight\+Alpha\+Texture} containing materials for straight alpha texture workflow ({\ttfamily Straight Alpha Texture} enabled). These directories contain a set of materials with {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} disabled for usage with {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color}} enabled at the component. Each directory also provides a subdirectory {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group\+Compatible} with materials with {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} enabled for usage with {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group} alpha (requiring {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color}} disabled at the component).
\item Skeleton\+Graphic\+: Added auto-\/detect functionality for parameters {\ttfamily Advanced} -\/ {\ttfamily Tint Black}, {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} and {\ttfamily PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color}}. If unsure which settings are correct, hit the {\ttfamily Detect} button next to each parameter, in top to bottom order, or the {\ttfamily Detect Settings} to detect all three. Also added automatic material assignment via a {\ttfamily Detect Material} button in the {\ttfamily Advanced} section and a {\ttfamily Detect} button next to the {\ttfamily Material} property at the top of the component Inspector, as well as next to the {\ttfamily Blend \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode} Materials} section when using multiple canvas renderers with blend modes. The suitable material is selected based on these three settings, combined with texture settings (PMA or straight alpha texture settings). If you receive incorrect results, likely your texture settings are incorrectly setup for your PMA or Straight alpha texture export settings.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture} example components now provide a {\ttfamily shader\+Passes} parameter to customize which passes are rendered to the {\ttfamily Render\+Texture}. It defaults to {\ttfamily -\/1} for all passes to keep the existing behaviour. You might want to set it to {\ttfamily 0} to only render the first pass e.\+g. to avoid issues when using a URP shader at the original skeleton.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Render\+Texture} example component now also received a {\ttfamily quad\+Material} property, defaulting to the newly added Material asset {\ttfamily Render\+Quad\+Graphic\+Material} which applies proper premultiplied-\/alpha blending of the render texture. The {\ttfamily quad\+Material} member variable was moved from {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture} to the common base class {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture\+Base}.
\item All \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Outline shaders, including the URP outline shader, now provide an additional parameter {\ttfamily Width in Screen Space}. Enable it to keep the outline width constant in screen space instead of texture space. Requires more expensive computations, so enable only where necessary. Defaults to {\ttfamily disabled} to maintain existing behaviour.
\item Added support for Blend\+Mode\+Materials at runtime instantiation from files via an additional method {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data\+Asset.\+Setup\+Runtime\+Blend\+Mode\+Materials}. See example scene {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Other Examples/\+Instantiate from Script} for a usage example.
\item Skeleton\+Graphic\+: You can now offset the skeleton mesh relative to the pivot via a newly added green circle handle. This allows you to e.\+g. frame only the face of a skeleton inside a masked frame. Previously offsetting the pivot downwards fails when {\ttfamily Layout Scale \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} scales the mesh smaller and towards the pivot (e.\+g. the feet) and thus out of the frame. Now you can keep the pivot in the center of the {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} while offsetting only the mesh downwards, keeping the desired skeleton area (e.\+g. the face) centered while resizing. Moving the new larger green circle handle moves the mesh offset, while moving the blue pivot circle handle moves the pivot as usual.
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton} shader now performs proper alpha-\/testing when {\ttfamily Depth Write} is enabled, using the existing {\ttfamily Shadow alpha cutoff} parameter.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} components now provide a public {\ttfamily \doxylink{test__rml__tbb_8cpp_a98b1050f09da390896f964fb7a892391}{Initialize()}} method which is automatically called when calling {\ttfamily skeleton\+Animation.\+Initialize(true)} to update the necessary skeleton references. If a different root bone shall be used, be sure to set {\ttfamily skeleton\+Root\+Motion.\+root\+Motion\+Bone\+Name} before calling {\ttfamily skeleton\+Animation.\+Initialize(true)}.
\item Skeleton Mecanim\+: Added new {\ttfamily Mix \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} {\ttfamily Match}. When selected, \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} animation weights are calculated to best match the provided Mecanim clip weights. This mix mode is recommended on any layer using blend tree nodes.
\item URP Shaders\+: Added {\ttfamily ZWrite} variant of outline shader {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Outline/\+Skeleton-\/\+Outline\+Only ZWrite}. Suitable for e.\+g. depth of field (DoF) effect where writing to the depth buffer is required. Note that for DoF effect, {\ttfamily Render Queue} needs to be set to {\ttfamily Alpha \doxylink{class_test}{Test}}.
\item Skeleton\+Graphic\+: Exposed {\ttfamily Set\+Scaled\+Pivot\+Offset} as public method outside of the editor to support programatically moving mesh offsets at runtime based on mesh bounds.
\item Skeleton\+Mecanim\+: Added {\ttfamily Scene Preview} option to preview an Animation Clip for e.\+g. easier event placement. When enabled, the Animation Clip selected in the Animation window is previewed in the Scene and Game views. Lock the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} Inspector window, open the Animation window and select the Animation Clip. Then in the Animation window scrub through the timeline to see the current animation frame previewed.
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader now supports \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/probevolumes-concept.html}{\texttt{ Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV)}} introduced in Unity 6. The shader also provides a new material property {\ttfamily APV per Pixel} to either calculate APV lighting contribution per pixel (the default) or per vertex.
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Sprite} shader now also supports \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/probevolumes-concept.html}{\texttt{ Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV)}} introduced in Unity 6. APV lighting contribution is automatically calculated per pixel.
\item All \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Outline shaders, including the URP outline shaders, now provide an additional parameter {\ttfamily Fill}. Enable it to also fill the opaque area inside the outline with the outline color. Prevents a semi-\/transparent gap between outline and skeleton. Defaults to {\ttfamily disabled} to maintain existing behaviour.
\item Added example component {\ttfamily Render\+Existing\+Mesh\+Graphic} (similar to {\ttfamily Render\+Existing\+Mesh}) to render a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} mesh again with different materials. This might be required by e.\+g. URP and Skeleton\+Graphic outline shaders skipping additional render passes. To add a second outline variant of your Skeleton\+Graphic\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add a Game\+Object at the same hierarchy level as the reference Skeleton\+Graphic and move it before the reference Skeleton\+Graphic to render behind.
\item Add a {\ttfamily Render\+Existing\+Mesh\+Graphic} component.
\item In the {\ttfamily Render\+Existing\+Mesh\+Graphic} component Inspector at {\ttfamily Reference Skeleton Graphic} assign the original {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} object.
\item At {\ttfamily Replacement Material} assign e.\+g. the included {\itshape Skeleton\+Graphic\+Default\+Outline} material to replace all materials with this material. Alternatively, if {\ttfamily Multiple Canvas\+Renderers} is enabled at the reference Skeleton\+Graphic, you can add entries to the {\ttfamily Replacement Materials} list and at each entry assign the original Skeleton\+Graphic material (e.\+g. {\itshape Skeleton\+Graphic\+Default}) to be replaced and the respective {\ttfamily Replacement Material} (e.\+g. {\itshape Skeleton\+Graphic\+Default\+Outline}).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_spine_shader_with_outline_g_u_i}{Spine\+Shader\+With\+Outline\+GUI}} outline related methods from {\ttfamily private} to {\ttfamily protected virtual} to allow for custom shader GUI subclasses to switch to different outline shaders.
\item Changed {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower} and {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower\+Graphic} methods {\ttfamily Late\+Update} and {\ttfamily Initialize} to {\ttfamily virtual} to allow easier overriding for e.\+g. positional offset in custom subclasses.
\item {\ttfamily Mesh\+Generator} received a new optimization option to avoid rendering fully transparent attachments at slot alpha 0 by default. Comment out {\ttfamily \#define SLOT\+\_\+\+ALPHA\+\_\+\+DISABLES\+\_\+\+ATTACHMENT} in {\ttfamily \doxylink{_mesh_generator_8cs}{Mesh\+Generator.\+cs}} to revert to previous behaviour. You may only need this option disabled when utilizing a custom shader which uses vertex color alpha for purposes other than transparency.
\item Physics\+Constraints\+: bool properties {\ttfamily Apply\+Translation\+To\+Physics} and {\ttfamily Apply\+Rotation\+To\+Physics} were changed to {\ttfamily Vector2 Physics\+Position\+Inheritance\+Factor} and {\ttfamily float Physics\+Rotation\+Inheritance\+Factor} to allow the Transform movement the be scaled by a factor before being applied to the skeleton. You can set the properties to {\ttfamily Vector2.\+zero} and {\ttfamily 0} respectively to disable applying any Transform movement at all. The {\ttfamily Advanced} Inspector section {\ttfamily Physics Constraints} was renamed to {\ttfamily Physics Inheritance}, the properties in the section are now called {\ttfamily Position} and {\ttfamily Rotation}.
\item Skeleton\+Graphic Materials\+: Since the addition of new material sets for the {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group\+Compatible} parameters, the default Skeleton\+Graphic materials all have {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} disabled. Please assign the respective material from the {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group\+Compatible} material subdirectory if you want {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} enabled at your Skeleton\+Graphic.
\item Skeleton\+Graphic\+: The parameter {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+Mesh\+Generator.\+settings.\+canvas\+Group\+Tint\+Black} was changed to {\ttfamily canvas\+Group\+Compatible} to help with auto-\/detecting correct \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} \doxylink{class_data}{Data} and Material settings. Set the parameter to true if the Skeleton\+Graphic component is located below a {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group} component. The parameter value is automatically migrated from {\ttfamily canvas\+Group\+Tint\+Black}.
\item Inspector\+: String attribute {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_spine_skin}{Spine\+Skin()}} now allows to include {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}None\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} in the list of parameters. Previously the {\ttfamily include\+None=true} parameter of the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_spine_skin}{Spine\+Skin()}} attribute defaulted to {\ttfamily true} but was ignored. Now it defaults to {\ttfamily false} and has an effect on the list. Only the Inspector GUI is affected by this behaviour change.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Render\+Texture} example component\+: {\ttfamily protected Raw\+Image quad\+Raw\+Image} was changed to {\ttfamily protected Skeleton\+Submesh\+Graphic quad\+Maskable\+Graphic} for a bugfix. This is only relevant for subclasses of {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Render\+Texture} or when querying the {\ttfamily Raw\+Image} component via e.\+g. {\ttfamily skeleton\+Graphic\+Render\+Texture.\+quad.\+Get\+Component\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Raw\+Image\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}()}.
\item Fixed a bug where when Linear color space is used and {\ttfamily PMA vertex colors} enabled, additive slots add a too dark (too transparent) color value. If you want the old incorrect behaviour (darker additive slots) or are not using Linear but Gamma color space, you can comment-\/out the define {\ttfamily LINEAR\+\_\+\+COLOR\+\_\+\+SPACE\+\_\+\+FIX\+\_\+\+ADDITIVE\+\_\+\+ALPHA} in {\ttfamily \doxylink{_mesh_generator_8cs}{Mesh\+Generator.\+cs}} to deactivate the fix or just to skip unnecessary instructions.
\item Fixed Skeleton\+Root\+Motion components ignoring parent bone scale when set by transform constraints. Using applied scale of parent bone now. If you need the old behaviour, comment out the line {\ttfamily \#define USE\+\_\+\+APPLIED\+\_\+\+PARENT\+\_\+\+SCALE} in \doxylink{_skeleton_root_motion_base_8cs}{Skeleton\+Root\+Motion\+Base.\+cs}.
\item Fixed Skeleton\+Utility callback update order when used with Skeleton\+Root\+Motion components so that the position when following a bone is updated after Skeleton\+Root\+Motion clears root-\/bone position. The order of Skeleton\+Utility\+Bone callbacks is changed to be later to achieve this. This is a breaking change in the unlikely case that you are using Skeleton\+Root\+Motion together with Skeleton\+Utility and subscribed to {\ttfamily Update\+Local}, {\ttfamily Update\+World} or {\ttfamily Update\+Complete} yourself and relied on a certain callback order. One solution is to then resubscribe your own callback events accordingly by calling {\ttfamily .Update\+Local -\/= Callback; .Update\+Local += Callback;}.

Then call e.\+g. the following code each frame\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Vector2\ currentPosition\ =\ <current\ world\ position>;}

\item {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment} and {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment} now provide a {\ttfamily Region} property. Use this property instead of the removed {\ttfamily Renderer\+Object} property (see section {\itshape Breaking Changes} below).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily Renderer\+Object} property from {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment} and {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment}. Use {\ttfamily attachment.\+Region} property instead. Removed removed {\ttfamily IHas\+Renderer\+Object} interface. Use {\ttfamily IHas\+Texture\+Region} instead.
\item Replaced {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+Update\+Offset} and {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+Update\+UVs} with {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Update\+Region}. The caller must ensure that the attachment\textquotesingle{}s region is not {\ttfamily null}.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Attachment\+Region\+Extensions} methods {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Set\+Region}, {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+Set\+Region} and {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+Set\+Region(region, update)}. Use {\ttfamily attachment.\+Region = region; if (update) attachment.\+Update\+Region()} instead.
\item {\ttfamily Attachment\+Loader.\+New\+Region\+Attachment()} and {\ttfamily Attachment\+Loader.\+New\+Mesh\+Attachment()} take an additional {\ttfamily Sequence} parameter.
\item {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment.\+Deform\+Attachment} property has been replaced with {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment.\+Timeline\+Attachment}.
\item {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+Compute\+World\+Vertices()} takes a {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot}} instead of a {\ttfamily Bone} as the first argument.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+Update(float delta\+Time)} method.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Slot.\+Attachment\+Time} property.
\item Removed extension method {\ttfamily Atlas\+Region.\+Get\+Spine\+Atlas\+Rect()} parameter {\ttfamily include\+Rotate} (with default value {\ttfamily true}). Most likely this method was never used with {\ttfamily include\+Rotate=false} in user code so no changes are required.
\item {\ttfamily Atlas\+Region.\+Packed\+Width} and {\ttfamily Atlas\+Region.\+Packed\+Height} are swapped compared to 4.\+0 when packing rotation is equal to 90 degrees. Most likely this property was never accessed in user code so no changes are required.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Officially supported Unity versions are 2017.\+1-\/2023.\+1}}.
\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset.\+Create\+Runtime\+Instance} methods now provide an optional {\ttfamily new\+Custom\+Texture\+Loader} parameter (defaults to {\ttfamily null}) which can be set to e.\+g. {\ttfamily (a) =\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} new Your\+Custom\+Texture\+Loader(a)} to use your own {\ttfamily Texture\+Loader} subclass instead of {\ttfamily Materials\+Texture\+Loader}.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now provide an Inspector parameter {\ttfamily Advanced} -\/ {\ttfamily Animation Update} with modes {\ttfamily In Update} {\bfseries{(previous behaviour, the default)}}, {\ttfamily In Fixed\+Update} and {\ttfamily Manual Update}. This allows to update animation in {\ttfamily Fixed\+Update} when using the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} component (which is the recommended combination now, issuing a warning otherwise). The reason is that when root motion leads to a collision with a physics collider, it can introduce jittery excess movement when updating animation in {\ttfamily Update} due to more {\ttfamily Update} calls following a single {\ttfamily Fixed\+Update} call.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} properties {\ttfamily Previous\+Rigidbody\+Root\+Motion} and {\ttfamily Additional\+Rigidbody2\+DMovement}. Setting or querying these movement vectors can be necessary when multiple scripts call {\ttfamily Rigidbody2\+D.\+Move\+Position} on the same object where the last call overwrites the effect of preceding ones.
\item {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower} and {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower\+Graphic} now provide an additional {\ttfamily Follow Parent World Scale} parameter to allow following simple scale of parent bones (rotated/skewed scale can\textquotesingle{}t be supported).
\item Improved {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Fix Prefab Override Mesh\+Filter} property for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} (and subclasses{\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim}), now providing an additional option to use a global value which can be set in {\ttfamily Edit -\/ Preferences -\/ \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}}.
\item Timeline naming improvements\+: {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Clip} Inspector parameter {\ttfamily Custom Duration} changed and inverted to {\ttfamily Default Mix Duration} for more clarity. Shortened all Timeline add track menu entries from\+: {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity_1_1_playables}{Spine.\+Unity.\+Playables} -\/ \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}track type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} to {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} -\/ \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}track type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation \doxylink{struct_state}{State} Track} to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Graphic Track} to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic Track}, and {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Skeleton Flip Track} to {\ttfamily Skeleton Flip Track}.
\item Timeline track appearance and Inspector\+: Tracks now show icons and track colors to make them easier to distinguish. When a Track is selected, the Inspector now shows an editable track name which was previously only editable at the Timeline asset.
\item Added example component {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture} to render a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} to a {\ttfamily Render\+Texture}, mainly for proper transparency. Added an example scene named {\ttfamily Render\+Texture Fade\+Out Transparency} that demonstrates usage for a fadeout transparency effect.
\item Added another fadeout example component named {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture\+Fadeout} which takes over transparency fadeout when enabled. You can use this component as-\/is, attach it in disabled state and enable it to start a fadeout effect.
\item Timeline clips now offer an additional {\ttfamily Alpha} parameter for setting a custom constant mix alpha value other than 1.\+0, just as {\ttfamily Track\+Entry.\+Alpha}. Defaults to 1.\+0.
\item {\ttfamily Get\+Remapped\+Clone} copying from {\ttfamily Sprite} now provides additional {\ttfamily pma\+Clone\+Texture\+Format} and {\ttfamily pma\+Clone\+Mipmaps} parameters to explicitly specify the texture format of a newly created PMA texture.
\item \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} property Inspector fields ({\ttfamily Animation Name}, {\ttfamily Bone Name}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot}} and similar) now display the name in red when the respective animation/bone/etc no longer exists at the skeleton data. This may be helpful when such items have been renamed or deleted.
\item Added {\ttfamily Unscaled\+Time} property at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} as well, behaving like {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+Unscaled\+Time}. If enabled, Animation\+State uses unscaled game time ({\ttfamily Time.\+unscaled\+Delta\+Time}), running animations independent of e.\+g. game pause ({\ttfamily Time.\+time\+Scale}).
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now provide an additional {\ttfamily On\+Animation\+Rebuild} callback delegate which is issued after both the skeleton and the animation state have been initialized.
\item Timeline {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic Track} now provide an {\ttfamily Unscaled Time} property. Whenever starting a new animation clip of this track, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation.\+Unscaled\+Time} or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+Unscaled\+Time} will be set to this value. This allows you to play back Timeline clips either in normal game time or unscaled game time. Note that {\ttfamily Playable\+Director.\+Update\+Method} is ignored and replaced by this property, which allows more fine-\/granular control per Timeline track.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} callback delegates {\ttfamily Process\+Root\+Motion\+Override} and {\ttfamily Physics\+Update\+Root\+Motion\+Override} to customize how root motion is applied. The new property {\ttfamily disable\+On\+Override} determines whether the callback will be issued in addition or instead of normally applying root motion. Added property {\ttfamily root\+Motion\+Scale\+Rotation} to allow scaling rotational root-\/motion to match e.\+g. a 90 degree rotation to a custom target angle.
\item Added outline shader parameter {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Opaque Alpha} which can be used to exclude problematic semi-\/transparent areas, which may receive an undesired large outline color overlay otherwise.
\item Added \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences setting {\ttfamily Prefabs} -\/ {\ttfamily Optimize Preview Meshes}. When enabled, \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} prefab preview meshes will be removed in a pre-\/build step to reduce build size. This increases build time as all prefabs in the project will be processed. Defaults to false to not slow down builds substantially every time.
\item Added \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences setting {\ttfamily Reload Skeleton\+Data after Play}. When enabled, the shared {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data} of all skeletons in the active scene is reloaded (from the {\ttfamily .json} or {\ttfamily .skel.\+bytes} file) after exiting play-\/mode. You can disable this setting to avoid the reloading delay if you can ensure that there are no (accidental) modifications to the shared {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data} during play-\/mode (otherwise it would carry over its effect into subsequent plays). Defaults to {\ttfamily true} (the safe setting), which maintains existing behaviour.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation\+Multi} sample component methods {\ttfamily Set\+Active\+Skeleton(int index)} and getter property {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animations} to more easily apply changes at all Skeleton\+Animation instances instead of only the active one.
\item PMA textures now have {\ttfamily s\+RGB (\doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color} Texture)} disabled by default, the preset template {\ttfamily PMATexture\+Preset.\+preset} has been adjusted accordingly. As PMA textures are only allowed with Gamma color space, {\ttfamily s\+RGB (\doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color} Texture)} shall be disabled to prevent border artifacts when mipmaps are enabled. In Gamma color space having this setting disabled has no drawbacks, only benefits.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Render\+Texture} components now support automatic down-\/scaling when required size on screen exceeds {\ttfamily Max Render Texture Size}.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Fill} shader to provide functionality of {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Fill} shader for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}.
\item Lit \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP shaders ({\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Sprite} and {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}) now support {\ttfamily Forward+} rendering path as introduced by Unity 2022.\+2 and URP version 14.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now supports automatic scaling based on its {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} bounds. Automatic scaling can be enabled by setting the added {\ttfamily Layout Scale \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} Inspector property to either {\ttfamily Width Controls Height}, {\ttfamily Height Controls Width}, {\ttfamily Fit\+In\+Parent} or {\ttfamily Envelope\+Parent}. It is set to {\ttfamily None} by default to keep previous behaviour and avoid breaking existing projects. To modify the reference layout bounds, hit the additional {\ttfamily Edit Layout Bounds} toggle button to switch into edit mode, adjust the bounds or hit {\ttfamily Match Rect\+Transform with Mesh}, and hit the button again when done adjusting. The skeleton will now be scaled accordingly to fit the reference layout bounds to the object\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform}.
\item Added previously missing unlit URP 2D shader variant, available under {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Skeleton}.
\item Added support for light cookies at {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Sprite} shader.
\item Timeline extension package\+: An additional \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} preferences parameter {\ttfamily Timeline} -\/ {\ttfamily Default Mix Duration} has been added, setting newly added {\ttfamily Spine\+Animation\+State\+Clip} clips accordingly, defaults to false. This \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} preferences parameter can be enabled to default to the previous behaviour before this update.
\item Tint Black\+: Added support for \href{http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-slots\#Tint-black}{\texttt{ Tint Black}} functionality at all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP shaders (2D and 3D shaders) and at all standard pipeline {\ttfamily Spine/\+Sprite} shaders. This feature can be enabled via the {\ttfamily Tint Black} material parameter in the Inspector. Note\+: The URP Sprite shaders provided in the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP Shaders extension UPM package require the latest version of the spine-\/unity runtime (package version 4.\+1.\+12, 2023-\/05-\/31 or newer) to display the added material parameters in the Inspector GUI.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+Mesh\+Scale} property to allow access to calculated mesh scale. {\ttfamily Mesh\+Scale} is based on (1) Canvas pixels per unit, and (2) {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} bounds when using {\ttfamily Layout Scale \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} other than {\ttfamily None} at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} which scales the skeleton mesh to fit the parent {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} bounds accordingly.
\item Added {\ttfamily update\+Separator\+Part\+Scale} property to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} to let render separator parts follow the scale (lossy scale) of the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Game\+Object. Defaults to {\ttfamily false} to maintain existing behaviour.
\item Added experimental {\ttfamily Editor\+Skeleton\+Player} component to allow Editor playback of the initial animation set at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} components. Add this component to your skeleton Game\+Object to enable the in-\/editor animation preview. Allows configurations for continuous playback when selected, deselected, and alternative single-\/frame preview by setting {\ttfamily Fixed Track Time} to any value other than 0. Limitations\+: At skeletons with variable material count the Inspector preview may be too unresponsive. It is then recommended to disable the {\ttfamily Editor\+Skeleton\+Player} component (at the top of the Inspector) to make it responsive again, then you can disable {\ttfamily Play When Selected} and re-\/enable the component to preview playback only when deselected.
\item Added example component {\ttfamily Render\+Combined\+Mesh} to render a combined mesh of multiple meshes or submeshes. This is required by {\ttfamily Outline\+Only} shaders to render a combined outline when using {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} or multiple atlas pages which would normally lead to outlines around individual parts. To add a combined outline to your Skeleten\+Renderer\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add a child Game\+Object and move it a bit back (e.\+g. position Z = 0.\+01).
\item Add a {\ttfamily Render\+Combined\+Mesh} component, provided in the {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Scripts/\+Sample Components} directory.
\item Copy the original material, add \+\_\+\+\_\+\+Outline\+\_\+ to its name and set the shader to your outline-\/only shader like {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Outline/\+Skeleton-\/\+Outline\+Only} or {\ttfamily Spine/\+Outline/\+Outline\+Only-\/\+ZWrite}.
\item Assign this \+\_\+\+\_\+\+Outline\+\_\+ material at the new child Game\+Object\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Mesh\+Renderer} component. If you are using {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} and need to enable and disable the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} component at runtime, you can increase the {\ttfamily Render\+Combined\+Mesh} {\ttfamily Reference Renderers} array by one and assign the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} itself at the last entry after the parts renderers. Disabled {\ttfamily Mesh\+Renderer} components will be skipped when combining the final mesh, so the combined mesh is automatically filled from the desired active renderers.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Timeline extension package\+: Added static {\ttfamily Editor\+Event} callback to allow editor scripts to react to animation events outside of play-\/mode. Register to the events via {\ttfamily Spine.\+Unity.\+Playables.\+Spine\+Animation\+State\+Mixer\+Behaviour.\+Editor\+Event += Your\+Callback;}.
\item URP Shaders\+: Added {\ttfamily Depth Write} property to shaders {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton} and {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}. Defaults to false to maintain existing behaviour.
\item Added {\ttfamily Animation Update} mode (called {\ttfamily Update\+Timing} in code) {\ttfamily In Late Update} for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}. This allows you to update the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} skeleton in the same frame that the Mecanim Animator updated its state, which happens between {\ttfamily Update} and {\ttfamily Late\+Update}.
\item URP Shaders\+: Added URP "{}\+Blend Mode"{} shader variants for both URP 3D and URP 2D renderers. They are listed under shader name "{}\+Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Blend Modes/"{} and "{}\+Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Blend Modes/"{} respectively.
\item URP Shaders\+: Added support for \href{http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-slots\#Tint-black}{\texttt{ Tint Black}} functionality at "{}\+Blend Modes"{} \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP shaders (2D and 3D shaders).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Made {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+unscaled\+Time} parameter protected, use the new property {\ttfamily Unscaled\+Time} instead.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} {\ttfamily On\+Rebuild} callback delegate is now issued after the skeleton has been initialized, before the {\ttfamily Animation\+State} component is initialized. This makes behaviour consistent with {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} component behaviour. Use the new callback {\ttfamily On\+Animation\+Rebuild} if you want to receive a callback after the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} {\ttfamily Animation\+State} has been initialized.
\item Changed name of prefab skeleton meshes stored at prefabs from {\ttfamily Skeleton Prefab Mesh "{}name"{}} to {\ttfamily Skeleton Prefab Mesh \mbox{[}name\mbox{]}} to avoid issues with quotes in mesh asset names (see \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/2572}{\texttt{ this issue}}). Likely this change poses no problems at all, however if you are parsing the prefab\textquotesingle{}s mesh name for whatever reason, be sure to adjust the pattern accordingly.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Changes of default values}}
\item {\bfseries{Deprecated}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}

Use RETURN\+\_\+\+UNLIT\+\_\+\+IF\+\_\+\+ADDITIVE\+\_\+\+SLOT\+\_\+\+TINT instead.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Restructuring (Non-\/\+Breaking)}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Moved \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} URP Shaders Examples directory from the main package directory to Samples which can be installed via the Unity Package Manager. To import, select the {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Universal RP Shaders} package in the Package Manager window, expand {\ttfamily Samples} at the bottom and hit {\ttfamily Import} next to {\ttfamily Examples}. This follows the standard \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-samples.html}{\texttt{ samples guideline}} and prevents warning messages about unexpectedly altered immutable assets.

Please see the example scene {\ttfamily Mix and Match Skins} on how to use the new Skin API to combine skins, or the updated old example scenes {\ttfamily Mix and Match} and {\ttfamily Mix and Match Equip} on how you can update an existing project using the old workflow.

with {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+Set\+Slots\+To\+Setup\+Pose()}. Replace\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Slot.\+Set\+Color\+To\+Setup\+Pose()}
\item {\ttfamily Slot.\+Set\+Attachment\+To\+Setup\+Pose()}
\end{DoxyItemize}

with {\ttfamily Slot.\+Set\+To\+Setup\+Pose()}.

Also removed less commonly used extension methods\+: {\ttfamily Track\+Entry.\+Allow\+Immediate\+Queue()}, {\ttfamily Animation.\+Set\+Keyed\+Items\+To\+Setup\+Pose()} and {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Is\+Renderable()}.
\item {\bfseries{{\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now no longer uses a {\ttfamily Raw\+Image} component at each submesh renderer}} Game\+Object when {\ttfamily allow\+Multiple\+Canvas\+Renderers} is true. Instead, a new custom component {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Submesh\+Graphic} is used which is more resource friendly. Replacement of these components will be performed automatically through editor scripting, saving scenes or prefabs will persist the upgrade.
\item {\bfseries{Linear color space\+:}} Previously \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot} colors were not displayed the same in Unity as in the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Editor. This is now fixed at all shaders, including URP and LWRP shaders. See section {\itshape Additions} below for more details. If you have tweaked \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot} colors to look correct in {\ttfamily Linear} color space in Unity but incorrect in \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}, you might want to adjust the tweaked colors. \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot} colors displayed in Unity should now match colors displayed in the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Editor when configured to display as {\ttfamily Linear} color space in the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Editor Settings.
\item {\bfseries{Additive Slots have always been lit}} before they were written to the target buffer. Now all lit shaders provide an additional parameter {\ttfamily Light Affects Additive} which defaults to {\ttfamily false}, as it is the more intuitive default value. You can enable the old behaviour by setting this parameter to {\ttfamily true}.
\item {\bfseries{Corrected blending behaviour of all {\ttfamily Sprite} shaders}} in {\ttfamily Premultiply Alpha} blend mode (including URP and LWRP packages). Previously vertex color alpha was premultiplied again, even though {\ttfamily Premultiply Alpha} blend mode assumes PMA texture and PMA vertex color input. Slot-\/alpha blending will thus be correctly lighter after upgrading to 4.\+0. If you have compensated this problem by disabling {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} Colors} you can now re-\/enable this parameter, also allowing for rendering Additive slots in a single pass.
\item {\bfseries{Corrected all {\ttfamily Outline} shaders outline thickness}} when {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Sample 8 Neighbourhood} is disabled (thus using {\ttfamily 4 Neighbourhood}). Previously weighting was incorrectly thick (4x as thick) compared to 8 neighbourhood, now it is more consistent. This might require adjustment of all your outline materials where {\ttfamily Sample 8 Neighbourhood} is disabled to restore the previous outline thickness, by adjusting the {\ttfamily Outline Threshold} parameter through adding a {\ttfamily /4} to make the threshold 4 times smaller.
\item Reverted changes\+: {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower} property {\ttfamily follow\+Local\+Scale} has intermediately been renamed to {\ttfamily follow\+Scale} but was renamed back to {\ttfamily follow\+Local\+Scale}. Serialized values (scenes and prefabs) will automatically be upgraded, only code accessing {\ttfamily follow\+Scale} needs to be adapted.
\item Fixed Timeline not pausing (and resuming) clip playback on Director pause, this is now the default behaviour. If you require the old behaviour (e.\+g. to continue playing an idle animation during Director pause), there is now an additional parameter {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t Pause with Director} provided that can be enabled for each Timeline clip.
\item Fixed Timeline {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Clips} ignoring empty space on the Timeline after a clip\textquotesingle{}s end. Timeline clips now also offer {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip} and {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration} parameters if you prefer the old behaviour of previous versions. By default when empty space follows the clip on the timeline, the empty animation is set on the track with a Mix\+Duration of {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration}. Set {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip} to {\ttfamily true} to continue playing the clip\textquotesingle{}s animation instead and mimic the old 3.\+8 behaviour. If you prefer pausing the animation instead of mixing out to the empty animation, set {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration} to a value less than 0, then the animation is paused instead.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Additions and Improvements}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Additional {\bfseries{Fix Draw Order}} parameter at Skeleton\+Renderer, defaults to {\ttfamily disabled} (previous behaviour). Applies only when 3+ submeshes are used (2+ materials with alternating order, e.\+g. "{}\+A B A"{}). If {\ttfamily true}, Material\+Property\+Blocks are assigned at each material to prevent aggressive batching of submeshes by e.\+g. the LWRP renderer, leading to incorrect draw order (e.\+g. "{}\+A1 B A2"{} changed to "{}\+A1\+A2 B"{}). You can leave this parameter disabled when everything is drawn correctly to save the additional performance cost.
\item {\bfseries{Additional Timeline features.}} Spine\+Animation\+State\+Clip now provides a {\ttfamily Speed Multiplier}, a start time offset parameter {\ttfamily Clip In}, support for blending successive animations by overlapping tracks. An additional {\ttfamily Use Blend Duration} parameter {\itshape (defaults to true)} allows for automatic synchronisation of Mix\+Duration with the current overlap blend duration. An additional \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} preferences parameter {\ttfamily Use Blend Duration} has been added which can be disabled to default to the previous behaviour before this update.
\item Additional {\ttfamily Sprite\+Mask and Rect\+Mask2D} example scene added for demonstration of mask setup and interaction.
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{boostmultiprec_8cpp_ad5abe8020ead32dcab5e3c15d6d7c30e}{Real} physics hinge chains} for both 2D and 3D physics. The \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonUtilityBone}{\texttt{ Skeleton\+Utility\+Bone}} Inspector provides an interface to create 2D and 3D hinge chains. Previously created chains have only been respecting gravity, but not momentum of the skeleton or parent bones. The new physics rig created when pressing {\ttfamily Create 3D Hinge Chain} and {\ttfamily Create 2D Hinge Chain} creates a more complex setup that also works when flipping the skeleton. Note that the chain root node is no longer parented to bones of the skeleton. This is a requirement in Unity to have momentum applied properly -\/ do not reparent the chain root to bones of your skeleton, or you will loose any momentum applied by the skeleton\textquotesingle{}s movement.
\item {\ttfamily Outline rendering functionality for all shaders.} Every shader now provides an additional set of {\ttfamily Outline} parameters to enable custom outline rendering. When outline rendering is enabled via the {\ttfamily Material} inspector, it automatically switches the shader to the respective {\ttfamily Spine/\+Outline} shader variant. Outlines are generated by sampling neighbour pixels, so be sure to add enough transparent padding when exporting your atlas textures to fit the desired outline width. In order to enable outline rendering at a skeleton, it is recommended to first prepare an additional outline material copy and then switch the material of the target skeleton to this material. This prevents unnecessary additional runtime material copies and drawcalls. Material switching can be prepared via a \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonRendererCustomMaterials}{\texttt{ Skeleton\+Renderer\+Custom\+Materials}} component and then enabled or disabled at runtime. Alternatively, you can also directly modify the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer.\+Custom\+Material\+Override} property. Outline rendering is fully supported on {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} shaders as well.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer.\+Editor\+Skip\+Skin\+Sync} scripting API property to be able to set custom skins in editor scripts. Enable this property when overwriting the Skeleton\textquotesingle{}s skin from an editor script. Without setting this parameter, changes will be overwritten by the next inspector update. Only affects Inspector synchronisation of skin with {\ttfamily initial\+Skin\+Name}, not startup initialization.
\item {\ttfamily Atlas\+Utilities.\+Get\+Repacked\+Attachments()} and {\ttfamily Atlas\+Utilities.\+Get\+Repacked\+Skin()} provide support for additional texture channels such as normal maps via the optional parameter {\ttfamily additional\+Texture\+Property\+IDs\+To\+Copy}. See the spine-\/unity runtime documentation, section \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#Combining-Skins}{\texttt{ Combining Skins -\/ Advanced -\/ Runtime Repacking with Normalmaps}} for further info and example usage code.
\item {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower} can now optionally follow (uniform) world scale of the reference bone. There is now a {\ttfamily \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} dropdown selector in the Inspector which can be set to either {\ttfamily Local} or {\ttfamily World Uniform}.
\item All {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic} shaders now provide a parameter {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} which can be enabled to support {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group} alpha blending. For correct results, you should then disable {\ttfamily Pma \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} Colors} in the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Inspector, in section {\ttfamily Advanced} (otherwise \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot} alpha will be applied twice).
\item {\bfseries{Now supporting Universal Render Pipeline (URP), including the 2D Renderer pipeline, through an additional UPM package.}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Installation\+:}} You can download the Unity Package Manager (UPM) package via the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity-download}{\texttt{ download page}} or find it in the \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/3.8-beta/spine-unity/Modules}{\texttt{ spine-\/runtimes/spine-\/unity/\+Modules}} subdirectory on the git repository. You can then either unzip (copy if using git) the package to
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a) the {\ttfamily Packages} directory in your project where it will automatically be loaded, or
\item b) to an arbitrary directory outside the Assets directory and then open Package Manager in Unity, select the {\ttfamily +} icon, choose {\ttfamily Add package from disk..} and point it to the package.\+json file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Project panel should now show an entry {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Universal RP Shaders} under {\ttfamily Packages}. If the directory is not yet listed, you will need to close and re-\/open Unity to have it display the directory and its contents.
\item {\bfseries{Usage\+:}} The package provides two shaders specifically built for the universal render pipeline\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton}, as a universal variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton} shader,
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}, as a universal variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader,
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Sprite}, as a universal variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Sprite/\+Vertex Lit} and {\ttfamily Pixel Lit} shaders, which were not functioning in the universal render pipeline,
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}, as a universal 2D Renderer variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader, and
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Sprite}, as a universal 2D Renderer variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Sprite/\+Vertex Lit} and {\ttfamily Pixel Lit} shaders. The shaders can be assigned to materials as usual and will respect your settings of the assigned {\ttfamily Universal\+Render\+Pipeline\+Asset} under {\ttfamily Project Settings -\/ Graphics}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Restrictions}} As all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} shaders, the URP shaders {\bfseries{do not support {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} (PMA) atlas textures in Linear color space}}. Please export your atlas textures as {\ttfamily straight alpha} textures with disabled {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} setting when using Linear color space. You can check the current color space via {\ttfamily Project Settings -\/ Player -\/ Other Settings -\/ \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color} Space.}.
\item {\bfseries{Example\+:}} You can find an example scene in the package under {\ttfamily com.\+esotericsoftware.\+spine.\+urp-\/shaders-\/3.\+8/\+Examples/\+URP Shaders.\+unity} that demonstrates usage of the URP shaders.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences now provide an {\bfseries{{\ttfamily Atlas Texture Settings}}} parameter for applying customizable texture import settings at all newly imported \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} atlas textures. When exporting atlas textures from \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} with {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} enabled (the default), you can leave it at {\ttfamily PMATexture\+Preset}. If you have disabled {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha}, set it to the included {\ttfamily Straight\+Alpha\+Texture\+Preset} asset. You can also create your own {\ttfamily Texture\+Importer} {\ttfamily Preset} asset and assign it here (include {\ttfamily PMA} or {\ttfamily Straight} in the name). In Unity versions before 2018.\+3 you can use {\ttfamily Texture2D} template assets instead of the newer {\ttfamily Preset} assets. Materials created for imported textures will also have the {\ttfamily Straight Alpha Texture} parameter configured accordingly.
\item All {\ttfamily Sprite} shaders (including URP and LWRP extension packages) now provide an additional {\ttfamily Fixed Normal Space} option {\ttfamily World-\/\+Space}. PReviously options were limited to {\ttfamily View-\/\+Space} and {\ttfamily Model-\/\+Space}.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now fully supports \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonUtility}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility}}} for generating a hierarchy of \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonUtilityBone}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Bones}}} in both modes {\ttfamily Follow} and {\ttfamily Override}. This also enables creating hinge chain physics rigs and using {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Constraints} such as {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Ground\+Constraint} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Eye\+Constraint} on {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}.
\item Added {\bfseries{native support for slot blend modes}} {\ttfamily Additive}, {\ttfamily Multiply} and {\ttfamily Screen} with automatic assignment at newly imported skeleton assets. {\ttfamily Blend\+Mode\+Material\+Assets} are now obsolete and replaced by the native properties at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data\+Asset}. The {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data\+Asset} Inspector provides a new {\ttfamily Blend Modes -\/ Upgrade} button to upgrade an obsolete {\ttfamily Blend\+Mode\+Material\+Asset} to the native blend modes properties. This upgrade will be performed automatically on imported and re-\/imported assets.
\item {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower} and {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower\+Graphic} components now provide better support for following bones when the skeleton\textquotesingle{}s Transform is not the parent of the follower\textquotesingle{}s Transform. Previously e.\+g. rotating a common parent Transform did not lead to the desired result, as well as negatively scaling a skeleton\textquotesingle{}s Transform when it is not a parent of the follower\textquotesingle{}s Transform.
\item {\bfseries{Linear color space\+:}} Previously \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot} colors were not displayed the same in Unity as in the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Editor (when configured to display as {\ttfamily Linear} color space in \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Editor Settings). This is now fixed at all shaders, including URP and LWRP shaders.
\item All \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} shaders (also including URP and LWRP shaders) now support {\ttfamily PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} Colors} in combination with {\ttfamily Linear} color space. Thus when using \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} shaders, you should always enable {\ttfamily PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} Colors} at the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} component. This allows using single pass {\ttfamily Additive} Slots rendering. Note that textures shall still be exported as {\ttfamily Straight alpha} when using {\ttfamily Linear} color space, so combine {\ttfamily PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} Colors} with {\ttfamily Straight Texture}. All {\ttfamily Sprite} shaders now provide an additional blend mode for this, named {\ttfamily PMA \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex}, Straight Texture} which shall be the preferred Sprite shader blend mode in {\ttfamily Linear} color space.
\item Additive Slots have always been lit before they were written to the target buffer. Now all lit shaders provide an additional parameter {\ttfamily Light Affects Additive} which defaults to {\ttfamily false}, as it is the more intuitive default value. You can enable the old behaviour by setting this parameter to {\ttfamily true}.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim\+Root\+Motion} components now support arbitrary bones in the hierarchy as {\ttfamily Root Motion Bone}. Previously there were problems when selecting a non-\/root bone as {\ttfamily Root Motion Bone}. {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+ScaleX} and {\ttfamily .ScaleY} and parent bone scale is now respected as well.
\item URP and LWRP {\ttfamily Sprite} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Lit} shaders no longer require {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Add Normals} enabled to properly cast and receive shadows. It is recommended to disable {\ttfamily Add Normals} if normals are otherwise not needed.
\item Added an example component {\ttfamily Root\+Motion\+Delta\+Compensation} located in {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Scripts/\+Sample Components} which can be used for applying simple delta compensation. You can enable and disable the component to toggle delta compensation of the currently playing animation on and off.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Ragdoll} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Ragdoll2D} now support bone scale at any bone in the skeleton hierarchy. This includes negative scale and root bone scale.
\item {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Get\+Remapped\+Clone(\+Sprite)} method now provides an additional optional parameter {\ttfamily use\+Original\+Region\+Scale}. When set to {\ttfamily true}, the replaced attachment\textquotesingle{}s scale is used instead of the Sprite\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Pixel per Unity} setting, allowing for more consistent scaling. {\itshape Note\+:} When remapping Sprites, be sure to set the Sprite\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Mesh \doxylink{ir__common_8h_a1ac75f8fee198af783521627f1fecfbc}{Type}} to {\ttfamily Full Rect} and not {\ttfamily Tight}, otherwise the scale will be wrong.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now {\bfseries{supports all \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot} blend modes}} when {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Multiple Canvas Renderers} is enabled in the Inspector. The {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Inspector now provides a {\ttfamily Blend \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode} Materials} section where you can assign {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} materials for each blend mode, or use the new default materials. New {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} shaders and materials have been added for each blend mode. The {\ttfamily Blend\+Modes.\+unity} example scene has been extended to demonstrate this new feature. For detailed information see the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#Parameters}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic documentation page}}}.
\item Timeline clips now also offer {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip} and {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration} parameters. By default when empty space follows the clip on the timeline, the empty animation is set on the track with a Mix\+Duration of {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration}. Set {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip} to {\ttfamily true} to continue playing the clip\textquotesingle{}s animation instead and mimic the old 3.\+8 behaviour. If you prefer pausing the animation instead of mixing out to the empty animation, set {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration} to a value less than 0, then the animation is paused instead.
\item Prefabs containing {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} now provide a proper Editor preview, including the preview thumbnail.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} (and subclasses{\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim}) now provide a property {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Fix Prefab Override Mesh\+Filter}, which when enabled fixes the prefab always being marked as changed. It sets the Mesh\+Filter\textquotesingle{}s hide flags to {\ttfamily Dont\+Save\+In\+Editor}. Unfortunately this comes at the cost of references to the {\ttfamily Mesh\+Filter} by other components being lost, therefore this parameter defaults to {\ttfamily false} to keep the safe existing behaviour.
\item {\ttfamily Bounding\+Box\+Follower} and {\ttfamily Bounding\+Box\+Follower\+Graphic} now provide previously missing {\ttfamily used\+By\+Effector} and {\ttfamily used\+By\+Composite} parameters to be set at all generated colliders.
\item {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower} and {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower\+Graphic} now provide an additional {\ttfamily Follow Parent World Scale} parameter to allow following simple scale of parent bones (rotated/skewed scale can\textquotesingle{}t be supported).
\item Improved {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Fix Prefab Override Mesh\+Filter} property for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} (and subclasses{\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim}), now providing an additional option to use a global value which can be set in {\ttfamily Edit -\/ Preferences -\/ \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}}.
\item Timeline naming improvements\+: {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Clip} Inspector parameter {\ttfamily Custom Duration} changed and inverted to {\ttfamily Default Mix Duration} for more clarity. Shortened all Timeline add track menu entries from\+: {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity_1_1_playables}{Spine.\+Unity.\+Playables} -\/ \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}track type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} to {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} -\/ \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}track type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation \doxylink{struct_state}{State} Track} to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Graphic Track} to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic Track}, and {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Skeleton Flip Track} to {\ttfamily Skeleton Flip Track}.
\item Timeline track appearance and Inspector\+: Tracks now show icons and track colors to make them easier to distinguish. When a Track is selected, the Inspector now shows an editable track name which was previously only editable at the Timeline asset.
\item Added example component {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture} to render a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} to a {\ttfamily Render\+Texture}, mainly for proper transparency. Added an example scene named {\ttfamily Render\+Texture Fade\+Out Transparency} that demonstrates usage for a fadeout transparency effect.
\item Added another fadeout example component named {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture\+Fadeout} which takes over transparency fadeout when enabled. You can use this component as-\/is, attach it in disabled state and enable it to start a fadeout effect.
\item Timeline clips now offer an additional {\ttfamily Alpha} parameter for setting a custom constant mix alpha value other than 1.\+0, just as {\ttfamily Track\+Entry.\+Alpha}. Defaults to 1.\+0.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now provides additional render callback delegates {\ttfamily On\+Instructions\+Prepared}, {\ttfamily Assign\+Mesh\+Override\+Single\+Renderer} and {\ttfamily Assign\+Mesh\+Override\+Multiple\+Renderers}. {\ttfamily On\+Instructions\+Prepared} is raised at the end of Late\+Update after render instructions are done, target renderers are prepared, and the mesh is ready to be generated. The two {\ttfamily Assign\+Mesh\+Override} delegates allow separate code to take over mesh and material assignment of a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} component.
\item Added example component {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Render\+Texture} to render a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} to a {\ttfamily Render\+Texture} (similar as {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Texture}), mainly for proper transparency. Extended example scene {\ttfamily Render\+Texture Fade\+Out Transparency} accordingly.

\item {\bfseries{Breaking change\+:}} refactored to ECMAScript modules. See this \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/blog/spine-goes-npm}{\texttt{ blog post}} as well as the updated \doxylink{external_2spine-runtimes_2spine-ts_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_8md}{README.md}.
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change\+:}} the {\ttfamily build/} folder and compiled artifacts are no longer part of the repository. Instead, {\ttfamily npm run build} in {\ttfamily spine-\/ts/} to generate ECMAScript modules and IIFE modules in {\ttfamily spine-\/\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}module-\/name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/dist}.
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change\+:}} the {\ttfamily .npmignore} and {\ttfamily package.\+json} files in the root directory have been deleted. Use the corresponding files in {\ttfamily spine-\/ts/} instead, or better, depend on the packages from the NPM registry.
\item Updated runtime to be compatible with Type\+Script 3.\+6.\+3.
\item Added {\ttfamily Asset\+Manager\#set\+Raw\+Data\+URI(path, data)}. Allows to set raw data URIs for a specific path, which in turn enables embedding assets into Java\+Script/\+HTML.
\item Expose non-\/essential colors on bones, bounding box, clipping, and path attachments.
\item Timeline API has been extended to support component-\/wise timelines exported by \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} 4.\+0.

\item Added support for texture atlas key value pairs, see {\ttfamily Atlas\+Region.\+names} and {\ttfamily Atlas\+Region.\+values}.
\item Added support for reverse animation playback via {\ttfamily Track\+Entry.\+reverse}.
\item Added proportional spacing mode support for path constraints.
\item Added support for uniform scaling for two bone IK.
\item Fixed applying a constraint reverting changes from other constraints.
\item {\ttfamily Asset\+Manager} constructor now takes an option {\ttfamily Downloader} instance. Used to download assets only once and share them between {\ttfamily Asset\+Manager} instances.
\item Added web worker support to {\ttfamily Asset\+Manager}.
\item Added various default parameters to {\ttfamily Animation\+State} methods for ease of use.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Canvas}, a simpler way to render a scene via spine-\/webgl. See {\ttfamily spine-\/ts/spine-\/webgl/examples/barebones.\+html} and {\ttfamily spine-\/ts/spine-\/webgl/examples/mix-\/and-\/match.\+html}.

See \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/1985}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/issues/1985}}
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change\+:}} reversal of the previous breaking change\+: the default fragment shader of {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mesh\+Material} does no longer discard fragments with alpha \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<} 0.\+5. Pass a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mesh\+Material\+Parameters\+Customizer} to the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mesh} constructor, and modify {\ttfamily parameters.\+alpha\+Test} to be \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} 0.

\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Player\+Config.\+raw\+Data\+URIs}. Allows to embed data URIs for skeletons, atlases and atlas page images directly in the HTML/\+JS without needing to load it from a separate file. See the example for a demonstration.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Player\+Config.\+frame}. If set, the callback is called each frame, before the skeleton is posed or drawn.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Player\+Config.\+update}. If set, the callback is called each frame, just after the skeleton is posed.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Player\+Config.\+draw}. If set, the callback is called each frame, just after the skeleton is drawn.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Player\+Config.\+downloader}. The {\ttfamily spine.\+Downloader} instance can be shared between players so assets are only downloaded once.
\item If {\ttfamily Spine\+Player\+Config.\+json\+URL} ends with an anchor, the anchor text is used to find the skeleton in the specified JSON file.
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Player.\+dispose()}, disposes all CPU and GPU side resources, removes all listeners, and removes the player DOM from the parent.

\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily x} and {\ttfamily y} coordinates for setup pose AABB in {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data}.
\item Added support for rotated mesh region UVs.
\item Added skin-\/specific bones and constraints which are only updated if the skeleton\textquotesingle{}s current skin contains them.
\item Improved Skin API to make it easier to handle mix-\/and-\/match use cases.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Skin.\+Get\+Attachments()}. Returns all attachments in the skin.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skin.\+Get\+Attachments(int slot\+Index, \doxylink{class_list}{List}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Skin\+Entry\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} attachments)}. Returns all attachements in the skin for the given slot index. This method replaces {\ttfamily Find\+Attachments\+For\+Slot} and {\ttfamily Find\+Names\+For\+Slot}.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skin.\+Add\+Skin(\+Skin skin)}. Adds all attachments, bones, and skins from the specified skin to this skin.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skin.\+Copy\+Skin(\+Skin skin)}. Adds all attachments, bones, and skins from the specified skin to this skin. {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment} are shallowly copied and will retain any parent mesh relationship. All other attachment types are deep copied.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Copy()} to all attachment type implementations. This lets you deep copy an attachment to modify it independently from the original, i.\+e. when programmatically changing texture coordinates or mesh vertices.
\item Added {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+New\+Linked\+Mesh()}, creates a linked mesh linkted to either the original mesh, or the parent of the original mesh.
\item Added IK softness.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Officially supported Unity versions are 2017.\+1-\/2020.\+2}}.
\item {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} {\ttfamily .asmdef} files are again active by default}}. They have previously been deactivated to {\ttfamily .txt} extension which is now no longer necessary.
\item {\bfseries{Removed Pose\+Skeleton() and Pose\+With\+Animation()}} extension methods to prevent issues where animations are not mixed out. Problem was that these methods did not set Animation\+State, leaving incorrect state at e.\+g. attachments enabled at slots when starting subsequent animations. As a replacement you can use {\ttfamily Animation\+State.\+Clear\+Track(0);} followed by {\ttfamily var entry = Animation\+State.\+Set\+Animation(0, animation, loop); entry.\+Track\+Time = time} to achieve similar behaviour.
\item {\bfseries{The {\ttfamily Shadow alpha cutoff} shader parameter is now respecting slot-\/color alpha}} values at all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} shaders. \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A} fragment\textquotesingle{}s texture color alpha is multiplied with slot-\/color alpha before the result is tested against the {\ttfamily Shadow alpha cutoff} threshold.
\item {\bfseries{Removed redundant {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Get\+Clone()} and {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+Get\+Linked\+Clone()} extension methods}}. Use methods {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Copy} and {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+New\+Linked\+Mesh()} instead.
\item {\bfseries{Renamed extension method {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Get\+Clone(bool clone\+Meshes\+As\+Linked)} to {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Get\+Copy(bool clone\+Meshes\+As\+Linked)}}} to follow the naming scheme of the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} API.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data\+Asset.\+atlas\+Assets} is now an array of the base class {\ttfamily Atlas\+Asset\+Base} instead of {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset}, which provides {\ttfamily IEnumerable\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Materials} instead of {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_list}{List}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} materials}. Replace any access via {\ttfamily atlas\+Asset.\+materials\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}} with {\ttfamily atlas\+Asset.\+Materials.\+First()} and add a {\ttfamily using System.\+Linq;} statement.
\item {\bfseries{Changed {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+Get\+Linked\+Mesh()} method signatures\+:}} removed optional parameters {\ttfamily bool inherit\+Deform = true, bool copy\+Original\+Properties = false}.
\item Changed namespace {\ttfamily Spine.\+Unity.\+Modules} to {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity}{Spine.\+Unity}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity_1_1_examples}{Spine.\+Unity.\+Examples}} after restructuring (see section below) in respective classes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When receiving namespace related errors, replace using statements of {\ttfamily using Spine.\+Unity.\+Modules.\+Attachment\+Tools;} with {\ttfamily using \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity_1_1_attachment_tools}{Spine.\+Unity.\+Attachment\+Tools};}. You can remove {\ttfamily using Spine.\+Unity.\+Modules;} statements when a {\ttfamily using \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity}{Spine.\+Unity}} statement is already present in the file.
\item {\ttfamily Attachment\+Tools}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Parts\+Renderer}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+Custom\+Materials} changed to namespace {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity}{Spine.\+Unity}}.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Ghost}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Ghost\+Renderer}, {\ttfamily Atlas\+Region\+Attacher}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Mirror}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Ragdoll}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Ragdoll2D}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Eye\+Constraint}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Ground\+Constraint}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Kinematic\+Shadow} changed to namespace {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine_1_1_unity_1_1_examples}{Spine.\+Unity.\+Examples}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Split {\ttfamily Editor/\+Utility/\+Spine\+Editor\+Utilities} class into multiple files with partial class qualifier.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Nested classes {\ttfamily Spine\+Editor\+Utilities.\+Asset\+Utility} and {\ttfamily Spine\+Editor\+Utilities.\+Editor\+Instantiation} are now no longer nested. If you receive namespace related errors, replace any occurrance of
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Spine\+Editor\+Utilities.\+Asset\+Utility} with {\ttfamily Asset\+Utility} and
\item {\ttfamily Spine\+Editor\+Utilities.\+Editor\+Instantiation} with {\ttfamily Editor\+Instantiation}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Timeline Support has been moved to a separate UPM Package}} Previously the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Timeline integration was located in the {\ttfamily Modules/\+Timeline} directory and was deactivated by default, making it necessary to activate it via the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences. Now the Timeline integration has been moved to an additional UPM package which can be found under {\ttfamily Modules/com.\+esotericsoftware.\+spine.\+timeline}.
\item {\bfseries{Installation\+:}} You can download the Unity Package Manager (UPM) package via the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity-download}{\texttt{ download page}} or find it in the \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/3.8-beta/spine-unity/Modules}{\texttt{ spine-\/runtimes/spine-\/unity/\+Modules}} subdirectory on the git repository. You can then either unzip (copy if using git) the package to a) the {\ttfamily Packages} directory in your project where it will automatically be loaded, or b) to an arbitrary directory outside the Assets directory and then open Package Manager in Unity, select the {\ttfamily +} icon, choose {\ttfamily Add package from disk..} and point it to the package.\+json file. The Project panel should now show an entry {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Timeline Extensions} under {\ttfamily Packages}. If the directory is not yet listed, you will need to close and re-\/open Unity to have it display the directory and its contents.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Layer Mix \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} enum name {\ttfamily Mix\+Mode.\+Spine\+Style} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Mix\+Mode.\+Hard}. This is most likely not set via code and thus unlikely to be a problem. Serialized scenes and prefabs are unaffected.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim\+Root\+Motion} components now support arbitrary bones in the hierarchy as {\ttfamily Root Motion Bone}. Previously there were problems when selecting a non-\/root bone as {\ttfamily Root Motion Bone}. {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+ScaleX} and {\ttfamily .ScaleY} and parent bone scale is now respected as well.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences stored in Assets/\+Editor/\+Spine\+Settings.\+asset}} Now \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} uses the new {\ttfamily Settings\+Provider} API, storing settings in a Spine\+Settings.\+asset file which can be shared with team members. Your old preferences are automatically migrated to the new system.
\item Added support for Unity\textquotesingle{}s Sprite\+Mask to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim}. All mask interaction modes are supported. See this \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/blog/Unity-SpriteMask-and-RectMask2D-support}{\texttt{ blog post}}.
\item Added support for Unity\textquotesingle{}s Rect\+Mask2D to Skeleton\+Graphics. See this \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/blog/Unity-SpriteMask-and-RectMask2D-support}{\texttt{ blog post}}.
\item Added {\ttfamily Create 2D Hinge Chain} button at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Bone} inspector, previously only {\ttfamily Create 3D Hinge Chain} was available.
\item {\bfseries{Now supporting Lightweight Render Pipeline (LWRP) through an additional UPM package.}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Installation\+:}} You can download the Unity Package Manager (UPM) package via the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity-download}{\texttt{ download page}} or find it in the \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/3.8-beta/spine-unity/Modules}{\texttt{ spine-\/runtimes/spine-\/unity/\+Modules}} subdirectory on the git repository. You can then either unzip (copy if using git) the package to
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a) the {\ttfamily Packages} directory in your project where it will automatically be loaded, or
\item b) to an arbitrary directory outside the Assets directory and then open Package Manager in Unity, select the {\ttfamily +} icon, choose {\ttfamily Add package from disk..} and point it to the package.\+json file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} If you are using git and Unity 2019.\+2 or newer versions and receive an error that dependencies could not be resolved by the package manager (only higher versions of Unity\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Lightweight RP} package are available, e.\+g. {\ttfamily 6.\+9.\+0} and up), please copy the prepared package-\/\+UNITYVERSION.\+json file for your Unity version (e.\+g. {\ttfamily package-\/2019.\+2.\+json}) over the existing package.\+json file to change the dependency accordingly. Unfortunately Unity\textquotesingle{}s Package Manager does not provide a way to specify a version range for a dependency like "{}5.\+7.\+2 -\/ 6.\+9.\+0"{} yet, so this manual step is necessary for git users.

The Project panel should now show an entry {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Lightweight RP Shaders} under {\ttfamily Packages}. If the directory is not yet listed, you will need to close and re-\/open Unity to have it display the directory and its contents.
\item {\bfseries{Usage\+:}} The package provides two shaders specifically built for the lightweight render pipeline\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Lightweight Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton}, as a lightweight variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton} shader,
\item {\ttfamily Lightweight Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}, as a lightweight variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader and
\item {\ttfamily Lightweight Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Sprite}, as a lightweight variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Sprite/\+Vertex Lit} and {\ttfamily Pixel Lit} shaders, which were not functioning in the lightweight render pipeline. The shaders can be assigned to materials as usual and will respect your settings of the assigned {\ttfamily Lightweight\+Render\+Pipeline\+Asset} under {\ttfamily Project Settings -\/ Graphics}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Restrictions}} As all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} shaders, the LWRP shaders {\bfseries{do not support {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} (PMA) atlas textures in Linear color space}}. Please export your atlas textures as {\ttfamily straight alpha} textures with disabled {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} setting when using Linear color space. You can check the current color space via {\ttfamily Project Settings -\/ Player -\/ Other Settings -\/ \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color} Space.}.
\item {\bfseries{Example\+:}} You can find an example scene in the package under {\ttfamily com.\+esotericsoftware.\+spine.\+lwrp-\/shaders-\/3.\+8/\+Examples/\+LWRP Shaders.\+unity} that demonstrates usage of the LWRP shaders.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit ZWrite} shader. This variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader writes to the depth buffer with configurable depth alpha threshold. Apart from that it is identical to {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}.
\item Additional yield instructions to wait for animation track events {\ttfamily End}, {\ttfamily Complete} and {\ttfamily Interrupt}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Wait\+For\+Spine\+Animation\+Complete} now proves an additional {\ttfamily bool include\+End\+Event} parameter, defaults to {\ttfamily false} (previous behaviour).
\item Added a new {\ttfamily Wait\+For\+Spine\+Animation\+End} yield instruction.
\item Added a new generic {\ttfamily Wait\+For\+Spine\+Animation} yield instruction which can be configured to wait for any combination of animation track events. It is now used as base class for {\ttfamily Wait\+For\+Spine\+Animation\+Complete} and {\ttfamily Wait\+For\+Spine\+Animation\+End}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Additional {\bfseries{Fix Draw Order}} parameter at Skeleton\+Renderer, defaults to {\ttfamily disabled} (previous behaviour). Applies only when 3+ submeshes are used (2+ materials with alternating order, e.\+g. "{}\+A B A"{}). If true, Material\+Property\+Blocks are assigned at each material to prevent aggressive batching of submeshes by e.\+g. the LWRP renderer, leading to incorrect draw order (e.\+g. "{}\+A1 B A2"{} changed to "{}\+A1\+A2 B"{}). You can leave this parameter disabled when everything is drawn correctly to save the additional performance cost.
\item {\bfseries{Additional Timeline features.}} Spine\+Animation\+State\+Clip now provides a {\ttfamily Speed Multiplier}, a start time offset parameter {\ttfamily Clip In}, support for blending successive animations by overlapping tracks. An additional {\ttfamily Use Blend Duration} parameter {\itshape (defaults to true)} allows for automatic synchronisation of Mix\+Duration with the current overlap blend duration. An additional \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} preferences parameter {\ttfamily Use Blend Duration} has been added which can be disabled to default to the previous behaviour before this update.
\item Additional {\ttfamily Sprite\+Mask and Rect\+Mask2D} example scene added for demonstration of mask setup and interaction.
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{boostmultiprec_8cpp_ad5abe8020ead32dcab5e3c15d6d7c30e}{Real} physics hinge chains} for both 2D and 3D physics. The \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonUtilityBone}{\texttt{ Skeleton\+Utility\+Bone}} Inspector provides an interface to create 2D and 3D hinge chains. Previously created chains have only been respecting gravity, but not momentum of the skeleton or parent bones. The new physics rig created when pressing {\ttfamily Create 3D Hinge Chain} and {\ttfamily Create 2D Hinge Chain} creates a more complex setup that also works when flipping the skeleton. Note that the chain root node is no longer parented to bones of the skeleton. This is a requirement in Unity to have momentum applied properly -\/ do not reparent the chain root to bones of your skeleton, or you will loose any momentum applied by the skeleton\textquotesingle{}s movement.
\item {\ttfamily Outline rendering functionality for all shaders.} Every shader now provides an additional set of {\ttfamily Outline} parameters to enable custom outline rendering. When outline rendering is enabled via the {\ttfamily Material} inspector, it automatically switches the shader to the respective {\ttfamily Spine/\+Outline} shader variant. Outlines are generated by sampling neighbour pixels, so be sure to add enough transparent padding when exporting your atlas textures to fit the desired outline width. In order to enable outline rendering at a skeleton, it is recommended to first prepare an additional outline material copy and then switch the material of the target skeleton to this material. This prevents unnecessary additional runtime material copies and drawcalls. Material switching can be prepared via a \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonRendererCustomMaterials}{\texttt{ Skeleton\+Renderer\+Custom\+Materials}} component and then enabled or disabled at runtime. Alternatively, you can also directly modify the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer.\+Custom\+Material\+Override} property. Outline rendering is fully supported on {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} shaders as well.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer.\+Editor\+Skip\+Skin\+Sync} scripting API property to be able to set custom skins in editor scripts. Enable this property when overwriting the Skeleton\textquotesingle{}s skin from an editor script. Without setting this parameter, changes will be overwritten by the next inspector update. Only affects Inspector synchronisation of skin with {\ttfamily initial\+Skin\+Name}, not startup initialization.
\item All {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic} shaders now provide a parameter {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} which can be enabled to support {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group} alpha blending. For correct results, you should then disable {\ttfamily Pma \doxylink{struct_vertex}{Vertex} Colors} in the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Inspector, in section {\ttfamily Advanced} (otherwise \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot} alpha will be applied twice).
\item {\bfseries{Now supporting Universal Render Pipeline (URP), including the 2D Renderer pipeline, through an additional UPM package.}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Installation\+:}} You can download the Unity Package Manager (UPM) package via the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity-download}{\texttt{ download page}} or find it in the \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/3.8-beta/spine-unity/Modules}{\texttt{ spine-\/runtimes/spine-\/unity/\+Modules}} subdirectory on the git repository. You can then either unzip (copy if using git) the package to
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a) the {\ttfamily Packages} directory in your project where it will automatically be loaded, or
\item b) to an arbitrary directory outside the Assets directory and then open Package Manager in Unity, select the {\ttfamily +} icon, choose {\ttfamily Add package from disk..} and point it to the package.\+json file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Project panel should now show an entry {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Universal RP Shaders} under {\ttfamily Packages}. If the directory is not yet listed, you will need to close and re-\/open Unity to have it display the directory and its contents.
\item {\bfseries{Usage\+:}} The package provides two shaders specifically built for the universal render pipeline\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton}, as a universal variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton} shader,
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}, as a universal variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader,
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Sprite}, as a universal variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Sprite/\+Vertex Lit} and {\ttfamily Pixel Lit} shaders, which were not functioning in the universal render pipeline,
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}, as a universal 2D Renderer variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader, and
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/2\+D/\+Spine/\+Sprite}, as a universal 2D Renderer variant of the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Sprite/\+Vertex Lit} and {\ttfamily Pixel Lit} shaders. The shaders can be assigned to materials as usual and will respect your settings of the assigned {\ttfamily Universal\+Render\+Pipeline\+Asset} under {\ttfamily Project Settings -\/ Graphics}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Restrictions}} As all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} shaders, the URP shaders {\bfseries{do not support {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} (PMA) atlas textures in Linear color space}}. Please export your atlas textures as {\ttfamily straight alpha} textures with disabled {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} setting when using Linear color space. You can check the current color space via {\ttfamily Project Settings -\/ Player -\/ Other Settings -\/ \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color} Space.}.
\item {\bfseries{Example\+:}} You can find an example scene in the package under {\ttfamily com.\+esotericsoftware.\+spine.\+urp-\/shaders-\/3.\+8/\+Examples/\+URP Shaders.\+unity} that demonstrates usage of the URP shaders.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences now provide an {\bfseries{{\ttfamily Atlas Texture Settings}}} parameter for applying customizable texture import settings at all newly imported \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} atlas textures. When exporting atlas textures from \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} with {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} enabled (the default), you can leave it at {\ttfamily PMATexture\+Preset}. If you have disabled {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha}, set it to the included {\ttfamily Straight\+Alpha\+Texture\+Preset} asset. You can also create your own {\ttfamily Texture\+Importer} {\ttfamily Preset} asset and assign it here (include {\ttfamily PMA} or {\ttfamily Straight} in the name). In Unity versions before 2018.\+3 you can use {\ttfamily Texture2D} template assets instead of the newer {\ttfamily Preset} assets. Materials created for imported textures will also have the {\ttfamily Straight Alpha Texture} parameter configured accordingly.
\item All {\ttfamily Sprite} shaders (including URP and LWRP extension packages) now provide an additional {\ttfamily Fixed Normal Space} option {\ttfamily World-\/\+Space}. PReviously options were limited to {\ttfamily View-\/\+Space} and {\ttfamily Model-\/\+Space}.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} now fully supports \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonUtility}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility}}} for generating a hierarchy of \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#SkeletonUtilityBone}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Bones}}} in both modes {\ttfamily Follow} and {\ttfamily Override}. This also enables creating hinge chain physics rigs and using {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Constraints} such as {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Ground\+Constraint} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Eye\+Constraint} on {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}.
\item Added {\ttfamily On\+Mesh\+And\+Materials\+Updated} callback event to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}. It is issued at the end of {\ttfamily Late\+Update}, before rendering.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton-\/\+Outline\+Only} single pass shader to LWRP and URP extension modules. It can be assigned to materials as {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Outline/\+Skeleton-\/\+Outline\+Only}. This allows for separate outline child {\itshape Game\+Objects} that reference the existing Mesh of their parent, and re-\/draw the mesh using this outline shader.
\item Added example component {\ttfamily Render\+Existing\+Mesh} to render a mesh again with different materials, as required by the new {\ttfamily Skeleton-\/\+Outline\+Only} shaders. In URP the outline has to be rendered via a separate Game\+Object as URP does not allow multiple render passes. To add an outline to your Skeleten\+Renderer\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add a child Game\+Object and move it a bit back (e.\+g. position Z = 0.\+01).
\item Add a {\ttfamily Render\+Existing\+Mesh} component, provided in the {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Scripts/\+Sample Components} directory.
\item Copy the original material, add \+\_\+\+\_\+\+Outline\+\_\+ to its name and set the shader to {\ttfamily Universal Render Pipeline/\+Spine/\+Outline/\+Skeleton-\/\+Outline\+Only}.
\item Assign this \+\_\+\+\_\+\+Outline\+\_\+ material at the {\ttfamily Render\+Existing\+Mesh} component under {\itshape Replacement Materials}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Added {\ttfamily Outline Shaders URP} example scene to URP extension module to demonstrate the above additions.
\item Added support for Unity\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteAtlas.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Sprite\+Atlas}}} as atlas provider (as an alternative to {\ttfamily .atlas.\+txt} and {\ttfamily .png} files) alongside a skeleton data file. There is now an additional {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Sprite\+Atlas Import} tool window accessible via {\ttfamily Window -\/ \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} -\/ Sprite\+Atlas Import}. Additional information can be found in a new section on the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#Advanced---Using-Unity-SpriteAtlas-as-Atlas-Provider}{\texttt{ spine-\/unity documentation page}}.
\item Added support for {\bfseries{multiple atlas textures at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}}}. You can enable this feature by enabling the parameter {\ttfamily Multiple Canvas\+Renders} in the {\ttfamily Advanced} section of the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Inspector. This automatically creates the required number of child {\ttfamily Canvas\+Renderer} Game\+Objects for each required draw call (submesh).
\item Added support for {\bfseries{Render Separator Slots}} at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}. Render separation can be enabled directly in the {\ttfamily Advanced} section of the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Inspector, it does not require any additional components (like {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Parts\+Renderer} for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} components). When enabled, additional separator Game\+Objects will be created automatically for each separation part, and {\ttfamily Canvas\+Renderer} Game\+Objects re-\/parented to them accordingly. The separator Game\+Objects can be moved around and re-\/parented in the hierarchy according to your requirements to achieve the desired draw order within your {\ttfamily Canvas}. \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A} usage example can be found in the updated {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Other Examples/\+Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} scene.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Custom\+Materials} component, providing functionality to override materials and textures of a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}, similar to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+Custom\+Materials}. Note\+: overriding materials or textures per slot is not provided due to structural limitations.
\item Added {\bfseries{Root Motion support}} for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} via new components {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim\+Root\+Motion}. The {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} component Inspector now provides a line {\ttfamily Root Motion} with {\ttfamily Add Component} and {\ttfamily Remove Component} buttons to add/remove the new {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} component to your Game\+Object. The {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} Inspector detects whether root motion is enabled at the {\ttfamily Animator} component and adds a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim\+Root\+Motion} component automatically.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} now provides an additional {\ttfamily Custom Mix\+Mode} parameter under {\ttfamily Mecanim Translator}. It is enabled by default in version 3.\+8 to maintain current behaviour, using the set {\ttfamily Mix \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} for each Mecanim layer. When disabled, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} will use the recommended {\ttfamily Mix\+Mode} according to the layer blend mode. Additional information can be found in the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#Parameters-for-animation-blending-control}{\texttt{ Mecanim Translator section}} on the spine-\/unity documentation pages.
\item Added {\bfseries{Skeleton\+Graphic Timeline support}}. Added supprot for multi-\/track Timeline preview in the Editor outside of play mode (multi-\/track scrubbing). See the \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#Timeline-Extension-UPM-Package}{\texttt{ Timeline-\/\+Extension-\/\+UPM-\/\+Package}} section of the spine-\/unity documentation for more information.
\item Added support for double-\/sided lighting at all {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Lit} shaders (including URP and LWRP packages).
\item Added frustum culling update mode parameters {\ttfamily Update When Invisible} (Inspector parameter) and {\ttfamily Update\+Mode} (available via code) to all Skeleton components. This provides a simple way to disable certain updates when the {\ttfamily Renderer} is no longer visible (outside all cameras, culled in frustum culling). The new {\ttfamily Update\+Mode} property allows disabling updates at a finer granularity level than disabling the whole component. Available modes are\+: {\ttfamily Nothing}, {\ttfamily Only\+Animation\+Status}, {\ttfamily Everything\+Except\+Mesh} and {\ttfamily Full\+Update}.
\item Added a new {\ttfamily Spine/\+Outline/\+Outline\+Only-\/\+ZWrite} shader to provide correct outline-\/only rendering. Note\+: the shader requires two render passes and is therefore not compatible with URP. The {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Other Examples/\+Outline Shaders} example scene has been updated to demonstrate the new shader.
\item Added {\ttfamily On\+Mesh\+And\+Materials\+Updated} callback event to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Render\+Separator} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Parts\+Renderer}. It is issued at the end of {\ttfamily Late\+Update}, before rendering.
\item Added {\ttfamily Root Motion Scale X/Y} parameters to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion\+Base} subclasses ({\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim\+Root\+Motion}). Also providing {\ttfamily Adjust\+Root\+Motion\+To\+Distance()} and other methods to allow for easy delta compensation. Delta compensation can be used to e.\+g. stretch a jump to a given distance. Root motion can be adjusted at the start of an animation or every frame via {\ttfamily skeleton\+Root\+Motion.\+Adjust\+Root\+Motion\+To\+Distance(target\+Position -\/ transform.\+position, track\+Index);}.
\item Now providing a {\ttfamily Canvas Group Tint Black} parameter at the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} Inspector in the {\ttfamily Advanced} section. When using the {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black} shader you can enable this parameter to receive proper blending results when using {\ttfamily Additive} blend mode under a {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group}. Be sure to also have the parameter {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group Compatible} enabled at the shader. Note that the normal {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic} does not support {\ttfamily Additive} blend mode at a {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group}, as it requires additional shader channels to work.
\item Added {\ttfamily Mix and Match Skins} example scene to demonstrate how the 3.\+8 Skin API and combining skins can be used for a wardrobe and equipment use case.
\item \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Timeline Extensions\+: Added {\ttfamily Hold Previous} parameter at {\ttfamily Spine\+Animation\+State\+Clip}.
\item Added more warning messages at incompatible Skeleton\+Renderer/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Component vs Material settings. They appear both as an info box in the Inspector as well as upon initialization in the Console log window. The Inspector box warnings can be disabled via {\ttfamily Edit -\/ Preferences -\/ \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}}.
\item Now providing {\ttfamily Before\+Apply} update callbacks at all skeleton animation components ({\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}).
\item Added {\ttfamily Bounding\+Box\+Follower\+Graphic} component. This class is a counterpart of {\ttfamily Bounding\+Box\+Follower} that can be used with {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}.
\item Added Inspector context menu functions {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer -\/ Add all Bounding\+Box\+Follower Game\+Objects} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic -\/ Add all Bounding\+Box\+Follower\+Graphic Game\+Objects} that automatically generate bounding box follower Game\+Objects for every {\ttfamily Bounding\+Box\+Attachment} for all skins of a skeleton.
\item {\ttfamily Get\+Remapped\+Clone()} now provides an additional parameter {\ttfamily pivot\+Shifts\+Mesh\+UVCoords} for {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment} to prevent uv shifts at a non-\/central Sprite pivot. This parameter defaults to {\ttfamily true} to maintain previous behaviour.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} components now provide an additional update mode {\ttfamily Only Event Timelines} at the {\ttfamily Update When Invisible} property. This mode saves additional timeline updates compared to update mode {\ttfamily Everything Except Mesh}.
\item Now all URP (Universal Render Pipeline) and LWRP (Lightweight Render Pipeline) shaders support SRP (Scriptable Render Pipeline) batching. See \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SRPBatcher.html}{\texttt{ Unity SRPBatcher documentation pages}} for additional information.
\item Sprite shaders now provide four {\ttfamily Diffuse Ramp} modes as an Inspector Material parameter\+: {\ttfamily Hard}, {\ttfamily Soft}, {\ttfamily Old Hard} and {\ttfamily Old Soft}. In spine-\/unity 3.\+8 it defaults to {\ttfamily Old Hard} to keep the behaviour of existing projects unchanged. From 4.\+0 on it defaults to {\ttfamily Hard} for newly created materials while existing ones remain unchanged. Note that {\ttfamily Old Hard} and {\ttfamily Old Soft} ramp versions were using only the right half of the ramp texture, and additionally multiplying the light intensity by 2, both leading to brighter lighting than without a ramp texture active. The new ramp modes {\ttfamily Hard} and {\ttfamily Soft} use the full ramp texture and do not modify light intensity, being consistent with lighting without a ramp texture active.
\item Added {\bfseries{native support for slot blend modes}} {\ttfamily Additive}, {\ttfamily Multiply} and {\ttfamily Screen} with automatic assignment at newly imported skeleton assets. {\ttfamily Blend\+Mode\+Material\+Assets} are now obsolete and replaced by the native properties at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data\+Asset}. The {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data\+Asset} Inspector provides a new {\ttfamily Blend Modes -\/ Upgrade} button to upgrade an obsolete {\ttfamily Blend\+Mode\+Material\+Asset} to the native blend modes properties. This upgrade will be performed automatically on imported and re-\/imported assets in Unity 2020.\+1 and newer to prevent reported {\ttfamily Blend\+Mode\+Material\+Asset} issues in these Unity versions. spine-\/unity 4.\+0 and newer will automatically perform this upgrade regardless of the Unity version.
\item {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower} and {\ttfamily Bone\+Follower\+Graphic} components now provide better support for following bones when the skeleton\textquotesingle{}s Transform is not the parent of the follower\textquotesingle{}s Transform. Previously e.\+g. rotating a common parent Transform did not lead to the desired result, as well as negatively scaling a skeleton\textquotesingle{}s Transform when it is not a parent of the follower\textquotesingle{}s Transform.
\item URP and LWRP {\ttfamily Sprite} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Lit} shaders no longer require {\ttfamily Advanced -\/ Add Normals} enabled to properly cast and receive shadows. It is recommended to disable {\ttfamily Add Normals} if normals are otherwise not needed.
\item Added an example component {\ttfamily Root\+Motion\+Delta\+Compensation} located in {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Examples/\+Scripts/\+Sample Components} which can be used for applying simple delta compensation. You can enable and disable the component to toggle delta compensation of the currently playing animation on and off.
\item Root motion delta compensation now allows to only adjust X or Y components instead of both. Adds two parameters to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Root\+Motion\+Base.\+Adjust\+Root\+Motion\+To\+Distance()} which default to adjusting both X and Y as before. The {\ttfamily Root\+Motion\+Delta\+Compensation} example component exposes these parameters as public attributes.
\item Root motion delta compensation now allows to also add translation root motion to e.\+g. adjust a horizontal jump upwards or downwards over time. This is necessary because a Y root motion of zero cannot be scaled to become non-\/zero.
\item {\ttfamily Attachment.\+Get\+Remapped\+Clone(\+Sprite)} method now provides an additional optional parameter {\ttfamily use\+Original\+Region\+Scale}. When set to {\ttfamily true}, the replaced attachment\textquotesingle{}s scale is used instead of the Sprite\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Pixel per Unity} setting, allowing for more consistent scaling. {\itshape Note\+:} When remapping Sprites, be sure to set the Sprite\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Mesh \doxylink{ir__common_8h_a1ac75f8fee198af783521627f1fecfbc}{Type}} to {\ttfamily Full Rect} and not {\ttfamily Tight}, otherwise the scale will be wrong.

\item {\bfseries{Changes of default values}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Layer Mix \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode}} now defaults to {\ttfamily Mix\+Mode.\+Mix\+Next} instead of {\ttfamily Mix\+Mode.\+Mix\+Always}.
\item {\ttfamily Blend\+Mode\+Material\+Asset} and it\textquotesingle{}s instance {\ttfamily Default Blend\+Mode\+Materials.\+asset} now have {\ttfamily Apply Additive Material} set to {\ttfamily true} by default in order to apply all blend modes by default.

\item Added {\ttfamily Spine\+Player\+Config\#raw\+Data\+URIs}. Allows to embed data URIs for skeletons, atlases and atlas page images directly in the HTML/\+JS without needing to load it from a separate file. See the example for a demonstration.

\item The completion event will fire for looped 0 duration animations every frame.
\item {\ttfamily Mix\+Pose} is now called {\ttfamily Mix\+Blend}
\item Skeleton {\ttfamily flip\+X/flipY} has been replaced with {\ttfamily scale\+X/scaleY}. This cleans up applying transforms and is more powerful. Allows scaling a whole skeleton which has bones that disallow scale inheritance

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added additive animation blending. When playing back multiple animations on different tracks, where each animation modifies the same skeleton property, the results of tracks with lower indices are discarded, and only the result from the track with the highest index is used. With animation blending, the results of all tracks are mixed together. This allows effects like mixing multiple facial expressions (angry, happy, sad) with percentage mixes. By default the old behaviour is retained (results from lower tracks are discarded). To enable additive blending across animation tracks, call {\ttfamily Track\+Entry\#set\+Mix\+Blend(Mix\+Blend.\+add)} on each track. To specify the blend percentage, set {\ttfamily Track\+Entry\#alpha}. See \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/forum/morph-target-track-animation-mix-mode-9459}{\texttt{ http\+://esotericsoftware.\+com/forum/morph-\/target-\/track-\/animation-\/mix-\/mode-\/9459}} for a discussion.
\item Support for stretchy IK
\item Support for audio events, see {\ttfamily audio\+Path}, {\ttfamily volume} and {\ttfamily balance} fields on event (data).
\item {\ttfamily Track\+Entry} has an additional field called {\ttfamily hold\+Previous}. It can be used to counter act a limitation of {\ttfamily Animation\+State} resulting in "{}dipping"{} of parts of the animation. For a full discussion of the problem and the solution we\textquotesingle{}ve implemented, see this \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/forum/Probably-Easy-Animation-mixing-with-multiple-tracks-10682?p=48130&hilit=holdprevious\#p48130}{\texttt{ forum thread}}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for vertex effects. See {\ttfamily Raptor\+Example.\+as}
\item Added \textquotesingle{}get\+Texture()\textquotesingle{} method to \textquotesingle{}Starling\+Texture\+Atlas\+Attachment\+Loader\textquotesingle{}
\item Breaking change\+: if a skeleton requires two color tinting, you have to enable it via {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Sprite.\+two\+Color\+Tint = true}. In this case the skeleton will use the {\ttfamily Two\+Color\+Mesh\+Style}, which internally uses a different vertex layout and shader. This means that skeletons with two color tinting enabled will break batching and hence increase the number of draw calls in your app.
\item Added {\ttfamily Vertex\+Effect} and implementations {\ttfamily Jitter\+Effect} and {\ttfamily Swirl\+Effect}. Allows you to modify vertices before they are submitted for drawing. See Starling changes.
\item Fix issues with Starling\+Atlas\+Attachment\+Loader, see \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/939}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/issues/939}}

\item Added support for overriding {\ttfamily Starling\+Atlas\+Attachment\+Loader\#get\+Texture()}, see \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/commit/ea7dbecb98edc74e439aa9ef90dcf6eed865f718}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/commit/ea7dbecb98edc74e439aa9ef90dcf6eed865f718}}

\item Added sample for additive animation blending, see \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/blob/6a556de01429878df47bb276a97959a8bdbbe32f/spine-starling/spine-starling-example/src/spine/examples/OwlExample.as}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/blob/6a556de01429878df47bb276a97959a8bdbbe32f/spine-\/starling/spine-\/starling-\/example/src/spine/examples/\+Owl\+Example.\+as}}
\item Added sample on how to use bounding box attachment vertices \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/commit/e20428b02699226164fa73ba4b12f7d029ae6f4d}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/commit/e20428b02699226164fa73ba4b12f7d029ae6f4d}}

\item The completion event will fire for looped 0 duration animations every frame.
\item The spine-\/cocos2dx and spine-\/ue4 runtimes are now based on spine-\/cpp. See below for changes.
\item Skeleton {\ttfamily flip\+X/flipY} has been replaced with {\ttfamily scale\+X/scaleY}. This cleans up applying transforms and is more powerful. Allows scaling a whole skeleton which has bones that disallow scale inheritance

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item {\ttfamily Animation\#apply} and {\ttfamily Timeline\#apply}{\ttfamily now take enums}Mix\+Pose{\ttfamily and}Mix\+Direction{\ttfamily instead of booleans}

\item Added {\ttfamily void \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}user\+Data} to {\ttfamily \doxylink{structsp_animation_state}{sp\+Animation\+State}}to be consumed in callbacks.
\item Added additive animation blending. When playing back multiple animations on different tracks, where each animation modifies the same skeleton property, the results of tracks with lower indices are discarded, and only the result from the track with the highest index is used. With animation blending, the results of all tracks are mixed together. This allows effects like mixing multiple facial expressions (angry, happy, sad) with percentage mixes. By default the old behaviour is retained (results from lower tracks are discarded). To enable additive blending across animation tracks, call {\ttfamily sp\+Track\+Entry-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}mix\+Blend = SP\+\_\+\+MIXBLEND\+\_\+\+ADD)} on each track. To specify the blend percentage, set {\ttfamily sp\+Track\+Entry-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}alpha}.

\item Optimized attachment lookup to give a 40x speed-\/up. See \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/commit/cab81276263890b65d07fa2329ace16db1e365ff}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/commit/cab81276263890b65d07fa2329ace16db1e365ff}}

\item Added ETC1 alpha support, thanks @halx99! Does not work when two color tint is enabled.
\item Added {\ttfamily sp\+Atlas\+Page\+\_\+set\+Custom\+Texture\+Loader()} which let\textquotesingle{}s you do texture loading manually. Thanks @jareguo.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+:set\+Slots\+Range()} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+::create\+With\+Skeleton()}. This allows you to split rendering of a skeleton up into multiple parts, and render other nodes in between. See {\ttfamily \doxylink{_skeleton_renderer_separator_example_8cpp}{Skeleton\+Renderer\+Separator\+Example.\+cpp}} for an example.
\item Fully transparent attachments will not be rendered, improving rendering performance.
\item Added improved tint-\/black shader.
\item Updated to cocos2d-\/x 3.\+16
\item The skeleton setup pose and world transform are now calculated on initialization to avoid flickering on start-\/up.
\item Updated to cocos2d-\/x 3.\+17.\+1
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change}}\+: Switched from \mbox{[}spine-\/c\mbox{]}(spine-\/c) to \mbox{[}spine-\/cpp\mbox{]}(spine-\/cpp) as the underlying \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} runtime. See the \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-cpp}{\texttt{ spine-\/cpp Runtime Guide}} for more information on spine-\/cpp.

\item All C structs and enums {\ttfamily sp\+XXX} have been replaced with their C++ equivalents {\ttfamily spine\+::\+XXX} in all public interfaces.
\item All instantiations via {\ttfamily new} of C++ classes from spine-\/cpp should contain {\ttfamily (\+\_\+\+\_\+\+FILE\+\_\+\+\_\+, \+\_\+\+\_\+\+LINE\+\_\+\+\_\+)}.

\item spine-\/c is now exposed from the plugin shared library on Windows via \+\_\+\+\_\+declspec.
\item Updated to Unreal Engine 4.\+18

\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+Component} generates collision meshes by default.
\item Disabled generation of collision meshes by {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+Component}. Both {\ttfamily Procedural\+Mesh\+Component} and {\ttfamily Runtime\+Mesh\+Component} have a bug that generates a new PhysiX file every frame per component. Users are advised to add a separate collision shape to the root scene component of an actor instead.
\item Using UE4 {\ttfamily FMemory} allocator by default. This should fix issues on some consoles.
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change}} moved away from {\ttfamily Runtime\+Mesh\+Component}, as its maintainance has seized, back to {\ttfamily Procedural\+Mesh\+Component}. Existing projects should just work. However, if you run into issues, you may have to remove the old {\ttfamily Spine\+Skeleton\+Renderer\+Component} and add a new one to your existing actors.
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change}} due to the removal of {\ttfamily Runtime\+Mesh\+Component} and reversal to {\ttfamily Procedural\+Mesh\+Component}, two color tinting is currently not supported. {\ttfamily Procedural\+Mesh\+Component} does not support enough vertex attributes for us to encode the second color in the vertex stream. You can remove the {\ttfamily Runtime\+Mesh\+Component/} directory from your plugins directory and remove the component from any {\ttfamily build.\+cs} files that may reference it.
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change}}\+: Switched from \mbox{[}spine-\/c\mbox{]}(spine-\/c) to \mbox{[}spine-\/cpp\mbox{]}(spine-\/cpp) as the underlying \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} runtime. See the \href{https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-cpp}{\texttt{ spine-\/cpp Runtime Guide}} for more information on spine-\/cpp.
\item All C structs and enums {\ttfamily sp\+XXX} have been replaced with their C++ equivalents {\ttfamily spine\+::\+XXX} in all public interfaces.
\item All instantiations via {\ttfamily new} of C++ classes from spine-\/cpp should contain {\ttfamily (\+\_\+\+\_\+\+FILE\+\_\+\+\_\+, \+\_\+\+\_\+\+LINE\+\_\+\+\_\+)}. This allows the tracking of instantations and detection of memory leaks via the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classspine_1_1_debug_extension}{spine\+::\+Debug\+Extension}}.
\item Updated to Unreal Engine 4.\+20 (samples require 4.\+17+), see the {\ttfamily spine-\/ue4/\+Plugins/\+Spine\+Plugin/\+Source/\+Spine\+Plugin/\+Spine\+Plugin.\+build.\+cs} file on how to compile in 4.\+20 with the latest UBT API changes.
\item Updated to Unreal Engine 4.\+21 (samples require 4.\+21).
\item {\bfseries{Breaking change}}\+: {\ttfamily UBone\+Driver\+Component} and {\ttfamily UBone\+Follower\+Component} are now {\ttfamily UScene\+Component} instead of {\ttfamily UActor\+Component}. They either update only themselves, or also the owning {\ttfamily UActor}, depending on whether the new flag {\ttfamily Use\+Component\+Transform} is set. See \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/pull/1175}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/pull/1175}}
\item Added query methods for slots, bones, skins and animations to {\ttfamily Spine\+Skeleton\+Component} and {\ttfamily UTrack\+Entry}. These allow you to query these objects by name in both C++ and blueprints.
\item Added {\ttfamily Preview Animation} and {\ttfamily Preview Skin} properties to {\ttfamily Spine\+Skeleton\+Animation\+Component}. Enter an animation or skin name to live-\/preview it in the editor. Enter an empty string to reset the animation or skin.

\item Support for stretchy IK
\item Support for audio events, see {\ttfamily audio\+Path}, {\ttfamily volume} and {\ttfamily balance} fields on event (data).
\item {\ttfamily Track\+Entry} has an additional field called {\ttfamily hold\+Previous}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Runtime and Editor, and Assembly Definition}} Files and folders have been reorganized into "{}\+Runtime"{} and "{}\+Editor"{}. Each of these have an {\ttfamily .asmdef} file that defines these separately as their own assembly in Unity {\itshape (Note\+: \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} {\ttfamily .asmdef} files are currently deactivated to {\ttfamily .txt} extension, see below)}. For projects not using assembly definition, you may delete the {\ttfamily .asmdef} files. These assembly definitions will be ignored by older versions of Unity that don\textquotesingle{}t support it.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In this scheme, the entirety of the base spine-\/csharp runtime is inside the "{}\+Runtime"{} folder, to be compiled in the same assembly as spine-\/unity so they can continue to share internal members.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} {\ttfamily .asmdef} files are now deactivated (using {\ttfamily .txt} extension) by default}} This prevents problems when updating \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} through unitypackages, overwriting the Timeline reference entry in {\ttfamily spine-\/unity.\+asmdef} (added automatically when enabling Unity 2019 Timeline support, see {\ttfamily Timeline Support for Unity 2019}), causing compile errors. In case you want to enable the {\ttfamily .asmdef} files, rename the files\+: {\ttfamily Spine/\+Runtime/spine-\/unity.\+txt} to {\ttfamily Spine/\+Runtime/spine-\/unity.\+asmdef} and {\ttfamily Spine/\+Editor/spine-\/unity-\/editor.\+txt} to {\ttfamily Spine/\+Editor/spine-\/unity-\/editor.\+asmdef}.
\item {\bfseries{Skeleton\+Animator is now Skeleton\+Mecanim}} The Spine-\/\+Unity Mecanim-\/driven component {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animator} has been renamed {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim} to make it more autocomplete-\/friendly and more obvious at human-\/glance. The .meta files and guids should remain intact so existing projects and prefabs should not break. However, user code needs to be updated to use {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mecanim}.
\item {\bfseries{Spine\+Atlas\+Asset}} The existing {\ttfamily Atlas\+Asset} type has been renamed to {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset} to signify that it specifically uses a Spine/lib\+GDX atlas as its source. Serialization should be intact but user code will need to be updated to refer to existing atlases as {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Atlas\+Asset\+Base}} {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset} now has an abstract base class called {\ttfamily Spine\+Atlas\+Asset}. This is the base class to derive when using alternate atlas sources. Existing Skeleton\+Data\+Asset field "{}atlas\+Assets"{} now have the "{}\+Atlas\+Asset\+Base"{} type. Serialization should be intact, but user code will need to be updated to refer to the atlas assets accordingly.
\item This change is in preparation for alternate atlas options such as Unity\textquotesingle{}s Sprite\+Atlas.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Optional Straight Alpha for shaders}} Spine-\/\+Unity\textquotesingle{}s included Unity shaders now have a {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+STRAIGHT\+\_\+\+ALPHA\+\_\+\+INPUT} shader\+\_\+feature, toggled as a checkbox in the Material\textquotesingle{}s inspector. This allows the Material to use a non-\/premultiplied alpha/straight alpha input texture.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The following shaders now have the "{}\+Straight Alpha Texture"{} checkbox when used on a material\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Tint Black}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Tint}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Fill}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic (Premultiply Alpha)} was renamed to {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black (Premultiply Alpha)} was renamed to {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton PMA Multiply}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton PMA Screen}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Dedicated straight alpha shaders were removed from the runtime.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Straight Alpha/\+Skeleton Fill}
\item {\ttfamily Spine/\+Straight Alpha/\+Skeleton Tint}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Detection of Incorrect Texture Settings}} Especially when atlas textures are exported with setting {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} enabled, it is important to configure Unity\textquotesingle{}s texture import settings correctly. By default, you will now receive warnings where texture settings are expected to cause incorrect rendering.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The following rules apply\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily s\+RGB (\doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color} Texture)} shall be disabled when {\ttfamily Generate Mip Maps} is enabled, otherwise you will receive white border outlines.
\item {\ttfamily Alpha Is Transparency} shall be disabled on {\ttfamily Premultiply alpha} textures, otherwise you will receive light ghosting artifacts in transparent areas.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item These warnings can be disabled in {\ttfamily Edit -\/ Preferences -\/ \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Sprite Mask Support for all Included Shaders}} The {\ttfamily Skeleton Animation} and {\ttfamily Skeleton Mecanim} components now provide an additional {\ttfamily Mask Interaction} field in the Inspector, covering identical functionality as Unity\textquotesingle{}s built in {\ttfamily Sprite Renderer} component\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Mask Interaction} modes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily None} -\/ The sprite will not interact with the masking system. Default behavior.
\item {\ttfamily Visible Inside Mask} -\/ The sprite will be visible only in areas where a mask is present.
\item {\ttfamily Visible Outside Mask} -\/ The sprite will be visible only in areas where no mask is present.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Automatically Generated Materials} When switching {\ttfamily Mask Interaction} modes in the Inspector outside of Play mode, the required additional material assets are generated for the respective {\ttfamily Stencil Compare} parameters -\/ with file suffixes `'\+\_\+\+Inside\+Mask\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily and}\textquotesingle{}\+\_\+\+Outside\+Mask\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily , placed in the same folder as the original materials. By default all generated materials are kept as references by the}Skeleton Animation{\ttfamily component for switching at runtime. These materials can be managed and optimized via the}Skeleton\+Animation{\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}s}Advanced{\ttfamily section\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using the
\end{DoxyItemize}}Clear{\ttfamily button you can clear the reference to unneeded materials,
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using the
\end{DoxyItemize}}Delete{\ttfamily button the respective assets are deleted as well as references cleared. Note that other}Skeleton Animation{\ttfamily Game\+Objects might still reference the materials, so use with caution!
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item With the
\end{DoxyItemize}}Set{\ttfamily button you can again assign a link to the respective materials to prepare them for runtime use. If the materials were not present or have been deleted, they are generated again based on the default materials.}
\item {\ttfamily When switching}Mask Interaction{\ttfamily mode at runtime, the previously prepared materials are switched active automatically. When the respective materials have not been prepared, material copies of the default materials are created on the fly. Note that these materials are not shared between similar}Skeleton Animation{\ttfamily Game\+Objects, so it is recommended to use the generated material assets where possible.}
\item {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\+Every shader now exposes the}Stencil Compare{\ttfamily parameter\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} for further customization. This way you have maximum flexibility to use custom mechanisms to switch materials at runtime if you should ever need more than the three materials generated by}Skeleton Animation{\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}s}Mask Interaction{\ttfamily parameter. Reference}Stencil Compare{\ttfamily values are\+: -\/}Compare\+Function.\+Disabled{\ttfamily for}Mask Interaction -\/ None{\ttfamily  -\/}Compare\+Function.\+Less\+Equal{\ttfamily for}Mask Interaction -\/ Visible Inside Mask{\ttfamily  -\/}Compare\+Function.\+Greater{\ttfamily for}Mask Interaction -\/ Visible Outside Mask{\ttfamily }
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\+Rect\+Mask2D Support for Skeleton\+Graphic\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} Both}Skeleton\+Graphic` shaders '{\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic}\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black}\textquotesingle{} now respect masking areas defined via Unity\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Rect\+Mask2D} component.
\item {\bfseries{Timeline Support for Unity 2019}} using the existing Timeline components. By default, all \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Timeline components are deactivated in Unity 2019 and {\bfseries{can be activated via the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Preferences menu}}. This step became necessary because in Unity 2019, Timeline has been moved to a separate Package and is no longer included in the Unity core. Please visit {\ttfamily Edit -\/ Preferences -\/ \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}} and at {\ttfamily Timeline Package Support} hit {\ttfamily Enable} to automatically perform all necessary steps to activate the Timeline components. This will automatically\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item download the Unity Timeline package
\item activate the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Timeline components by setting the compile definition {\ttfamily SPINE\+\_\+\+TIMELINE\+\_\+\+PACKAGE\+\_\+\+DOWNLOADED} for all platforms
\item modify the {\ttfamily spine-\/unity.\+asmdef} file by adding the reference to the Unity Timeline library.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Added {\ttfamily Create 2D Hinge Chain} functionality at {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Utility\+Bone} inspector, previously only {\ttfamily Create 3D Hinge Chain} was available.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for any {\ttfamily Effect} to be used by {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}
\item Added support for {\ttfamily IVertex\+Effect} to modify vertices of skeletons on the CPU. {\ttfamily IVertex\+Effect} instances can be set on the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. See example project.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Debug\+Renderer}
\item Made {\ttfamily Mesh\+Batcher} of Skeleton\+Renderer accessible via a getter. Allows user to batch their own geometry together with skeleton meshes for maximum batching instead of using XNA Sprite\+Batcher.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_external_2spine-runtimes_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md891}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Java}{Java}}\label{md_external_2spine-runtimes_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md891}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Skeleton attachments\+: Moved update of attached skeleton out of lib\+GDX {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}, added overloaded method {\ttfamily Skeleton\#update\+World\+Transform(\+Bone)}, used for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Attachment}. You now MUST call this new method with the bone of the parent skeleton to which the child skeleton is attached. See {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Attachment\+Test} for and example.
\item The completion event will fire for looped 0 duration animations every frame.
\item {\ttfamily Mix\+Pose} is now called {\ttfamily Mix\+Blend}.
\item Skeleton {\ttfamily flip\+X/flipY} has been replaced with {\ttfamily scale\+X/scaleY}. This cleans up applying transforms and is more powerful. Allows scaling a whole skeleton which has bones that disallow scale inheritance
\item Mix time is no longer affected by {\ttfamily Track\+Entry\#time\+Scale}. See \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/1194}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/issues/1194}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Event\+Data\#audio\+Path} field. This field contains the file name of the audio file used for the event.
\item Added convenience method to add all attachments from one skin to another, see \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/commit/a0b7bb6c445efdfac12b0cdee2057afa3eff3ead}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/commit/a0b7bb6c445efdfac12b0cdee2057afa3eff3ead}}
\item Added additive animation blending. When playing back multiple animations on different tracks, where each animation modifies the same skeleton property, the results of tracks with lower indices are discarded, and only the result from the track with the highest index is used. With animation blending, the results of all tracks are mixed together. This allows effects like mixing multiple facial expressions (angry, happy, sad) with percentage mixes. By default the old behaviour is retained (results from lower tracks are discarded). To enable additive blending across animation tracks, call {\ttfamily Track\+Entry\#set\+Mix\+Blend(Mix\+Blend.\+add)} on each track. To specify the blend percentage, set {\ttfamily Track\+Entry\#alpha}. See \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/forum/morph-target-track-animation-mix-mode-9459}{\texttt{ http\+://esotericsoftware.\+com/forum/morph-\/target-\/track-\/animation-\/mix-\/mode-\/9459}} for a discussion.
\item Support for stretchy IK
\item Support for audio events, see {\ttfamily audio\+Path}, {\ttfamily volume} and {\ttfamily balance} fields on event (data).
\item {\ttfamily Track\+Entry} has an additional field called {\ttfamily hold\+Previous}. It can be used to counter act a limitation of {\ttfamily Animation\+State} resulting in "{}dipping"{} of parts of the animation. For a full discussion of the problem and the solution we\textquotesingle{}ve implemented, see this \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/forum/Probably-Easy-Animation-mixing-with-multiple-tracks-10682?p=48130&hilit=holdprevious\#p48130}{\texttt{ forum thread}}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Vertex\+Effect} interface, instances of which can be set on {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. Allows to modify vertices before submitting them to GPU. See {\ttfamily Swirl\+Effect}, {\ttfamily Jitter\+Effect} and {\ttfamily Vertex\+Effect\+Test}.
\item Added improved tint-\/black shader.
\item Improved performance by avoiding batch flush when not switching between normal and additive rendering with PMA
\item Improvements to skeleton viewer.
\item {\ttfamily Two\+Color\+Polygon\+Batch} implements the {\ttfamily Batch} interface, allowing to the be used with other lib\+GDX classes that require a batcher for drawing, potentially improving performance. See \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/commit/a46b3d1d0c135d51f9bef9ca17a5f8e5dda69927}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Esoteric\+Software/spine-\/runtimes/commit/a46b3d1d0c135d51f9bef9ca17a5f8e5dda69927}}

\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Asset\+Manager.\+load\+Texture\+Atlas}. Instead of loading the {\ttfamily .atlas} and corresponding image files manually, you can simply specify the location of the {\ttfamily .atlas} file and Asset\+Manager will load the atlas and all its images automatically. {\ttfamily Asset\+Manager.\+get("{}atlasname.\+atlas"{})} will then return an instance of {\ttfamily spine.\+Texture\+Atlas}.

\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily Bone.\+world\+To\+Local\+RotationX} and {\ttfamily Bone.\+world\+To\+Local\+RotationY}. Replaced by {\ttfamily Bone.\+world\+To\+Local\+Rotation} (rotation given relative to x-\/axis, counter-\/clockwise, in degrees).
\item Made {\ttfamily Bone} fields {\ttfamily \+\_\+a}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+b}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+c}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+d}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+worldX} and {\ttfamily \+\_\+worldY} public, removed underscore prefix.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices} overload, changed {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices2} to {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices}, added {\ttfamily stride} parameter.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+vertices} field. The vertices array is provided to {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices} by the API user now.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+update\+World\+Vertices}, added {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices}. The new method now computes the x/y positions of the 4 vertices of the corner and places them in the provided {\ttfamily world\+Vertices} array, starting at {\ttfamily offset}, then moving by {\ttfamily stride} array elements when advancing to the next vertex. This allows to directly compose the vertex buffer and avoids a copy. The computation of the full vertices, including vertex colors and texture coordinates, is now done by the backend\textquotesingle{}s respective renderer.
\item Replaced {\ttfamily r}, {\ttfamily g}, {\ttfamily b}, {\ttfamily a} fields with instances of new {\ttfamily \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color}} class in {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment}, {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment}, {\ttfamily Skeleton}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot}} and {\ttfamily Slot\+Data}.
\item The completion event will fire for looped 0 duration animations every frame.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+get\+Bounds} from reference implementation.
\item Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in {\ttfamily Transform\+Constraint\+Data}
\item Added {\ttfamily Bone.\+local\+To\+World\+Rotation}(rotation given relative to x-\/axis, counter-\/clockwise, in degrees).
\item Added two color tinting support, including {\ttfamily Two\+Color\+Timeline} and additional fields on {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_slot}{Slot}} and {\ttfamily Slot\+Data}.
\item Added {\ttfamily Point\+Attachment}, additional method {\ttfamily new\+Point\+Attachment} in {\ttfamily Attachment\+Loader} interface.
\item Added {\ttfamily Clipping\+Attachment}, additional method {\ttfamily new\+Clipping\+Attachment} in {\ttfamily Attachment\+Loader} interface.
\item {\ttfamily Animation\+State\#apply} returns boolean indicating if any timeline was applied or not.
\item {\ttfamily Animation\#apply} and {\ttfamily Timeline\#apply}{\ttfamily now take enums}Mix\+Pose{\ttfamily and}Mix\+Direction{\ttfamily instead of booleans}
\item {\ttfamily Added}Vertex\+Effect{\ttfamily and implementations}Jitter\+Effect{\ttfamily and}Swirl\+Effect\`{}. Allows you to modify vertices before they are submitted for drawing. See Starling changes.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed renderer to work with 3.\+6 changes.
\item Added support for two color tinting.
\item Added support for clipping.
\item Added support for rotated regions in texture atlas loaded via Starling\+Atlas\+Attachment\+Loader.
\item Added support for vertex effects. See {\ttfamily Raptor\+Example.\+as}
\item Added \textquotesingle{}get\+Texture()\textquotesingle{} method to \textquotesingle{}Starling\+Texture\+Atlas\+Attachment\+Loader\textquotesingle{}
\item Breaking change\+: if a skeleton requires two color tinting, you have to enable it via {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Sprite.\+two\+Color\+Tint = true}. In this case the skeleton will use the {\ttfamily Two\+Color\+Mesh\+Style}, which internally uses a different vertex layout and shader. This means that skeletons with two color tinting enabled will break batching and hence increase the number of draw calls in your app.

\item {\bfseries{Additions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for local and relative transform constraint calculation, including additional fields in {\ttfamily \doxylink{structsp_transform_constraint_data}{sp\+Transform\+Constraint\+Data}}.
\item Added {\ttfamily \doxylink{structsp_point_attachment}{sp\+Point\+Attachment}}, additional method {\ttfamily sp\+Atlas\+Attachment\+Loade\+R\+\_\+new\+Point\+Attachment}.

\item Added {\ttfamily user\+Data} field to {\ttfamily \doxylink{structsp_track_entry}{sp\+Track\+Entry}}, so users can expose data in {\ttfamily \doxylink{structsp_animation_state}{sp\+Animation\+State}} callbacks.
\item Modified kvec.\+h used by \doxylink{_skeleton_binary_8c}{Skeleton\+Binary.\+c} to use \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}\textquotesingle{}s MALLOC/\+FREE macros. That way there\textquotesingle{}s only one place to inject custom allocators (\href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/blob/master/spine-c/spine-c/include/spine/extension.h}{\texttt{ extension.\+h}}) \href{https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/commit/c2cfbc6cb8709daa082726222d558188d75a004f}{\texttt{ commit}}
\item Added macros to define typed dynamic arrays, see {\ttfamily Array.\+h/.c}
\item Added {\ttfamily \doxylink{structsp_clipping_attachment}{sp\+Clipping\+Attachment}} and respective enum.
\item Added {\ttfamily sp\+Skeleton\+Clipper} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{structsp_triangulator}{sp\+Triangulator}}, used to implement software clipping of attachments.
\item {\ttfamily Animation\+State\#apply} returns boolean indicating if any timeline was applied or not.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed renderer to work with 3.\+6 changes
\item Optimized rendering by removing all per-\/frame allocation in {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}, resulting in 15\% performance increase for large numbers of skeletons being rendered per frame.
\item Added support for two color tinting. Tinting is enabled/disabled per {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}/{\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} instance. Use {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+::set\+Two\+Color\+Tint()}. Note that two color tinting requires the use of a non-\/standard shader and vertex format. This means that skeletons rendered with two color tinting will break batching. However, skeletons with two color tinting enabled and rendered after each other will be batched.
\item Updated example to use Cocos2d-\/x 3.\+14.\+1.
\item Added mesh debug rendering. Enable/\+Disable via {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+::set\+Debug\+Meshes\+Enabled()}.
\item Added support for clipping.
\item Skeleton\+Renderer now combines the displayed color of the \doxylink{class_node}{Node} (cascaded from all parents) with the skeleton color for tinting.
\item Added support for vertex effects. See {\ttfamily \doxylink{_raptor_example_8cpp}{Raptor\+Example.\+cpp}}.
\item Added ETC1 alpha support, thanks @halx99! Does not work when two color tint is enabled.
\item Added {\ttfamily sp\+Atlas\+Page\+\_\+set\+Custom\+Texture\+Loader()} which let\textquotesingle{}s you do texture loading manually. Thanks @jareguo.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+:set\+Slots\+Range()} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\+::create\+With\+Skeleton()}. This allows you to split rendering of a skeleton up into multiple parts, and render other nodes in between. See {\ttfamily \doxylink{_skeleton_renderer_separator_example_8cpp}{Skeleton\+Renderer\+Separator\+Example.\+cpp}} for an example.

\item Fixed renderer to work with 3.\+6 changes. Sadly, two color tinting does not work, as the vertex format in SFML is fixed.
\item Added support for clipping.
\item Added support for vertex effects. See raptor example.
\item Added premultiplied alpha support to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Drawable}.

\item Fixed renderer to work with 3.\+6 changes
\item Added new UPROPERTY to Spine\+Skeleton\+Renderer\+Component called {\ttfamily \doxylink{external_2magic__enum_2example_2example_8cpp_a692f5062ca261bdb3a62a63faddfd27f}{Color}}. This allows to set the tint color of the skeleton in the editor, C++ and Blueprints. Under the hood, the {\ttfamily sp\+Skeleton-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}color} will be set on every tick of the renderer component.
\item Added support for clipping.
\item Switched from built-\/in Procedural\+Mesh\+Component to Runtime\+Mesh\+Component by Koderz (\href{https://github.com/Koderz/UE4RuntimeMeshComponent}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Koderz/\+UE4\+Runtime\+Mesh\+Component}}, MIT). Needed for more flexibility regarding vertex format, should not have an impact on existing code/assets. You need to copy the Runtime\+Mesh\+Component\+Plugin from our repository in {\ttfamily spine-\/ue4\textbackslash{}Plugins\textbackslash{}} to your project as well!
\item Added support for two color tinting. All base materials, e.\+g. Spine\+Unlit\+Normal\+Material, now do proper two color tinting. No material parameters have changed.
\item Updated to Unreal Engine 4.\+16.\+1. Note that 4.\+16 has a regression which will make it impossible to compile plain .c files!
\item spine-\/c is now exposed from the plugin shared library on Windows via \+\_\+\+\_\+declspec.

\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+parent\+Mesh} is now a private field to enforce using the {\ttfamily .Parent\+Mesh} setter property in external code. The {\ttfamily Mesh\+Attachment.\+Parent\+Mesh} property is an appropriate replacement wherever {\ttfamily .parent\+Mesh} was used.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+Get\+Bounds} takes a scratch array as input so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to allocate a new array on each invocation itself. Reduces GC activity.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Bone.\+World\+To\+Local\+RotationX} and {\ttfamily Bone.\+World\+To\+Local\+RotationY}. Replaced by {\ttfamily Bone.\+World\+To\+Local\+Rotation} (rotation given relative to x-\/axis, counter-\/clockwise, in degrees).
\item Added {\ttfamily stride} parameter to {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment.\+Compute\+World\+Vertices}.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+Vertices} field. The vertices array is provided to {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+Compute\+World\+Vertices} by the API user now.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+Update\+World\+Vertices}, added {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+Compute\+World\+Vertices}. The new method now computes the x/y positions of the 4 vertices of the corner and places them in the provided {\ttfamily world\+Vertices} array, starting at {\ttfamily offset}, then moving by {\ttfamily stride} array elements when advancing to the next vertex. This allows to directly compose the vertex buffer and avoids a copy.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Refactored renderer to work with new 3.\+6 features.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Two color tinting}} is currently supported via extra UV2 and UV3 mesh vertex streams. To use Two color tinting, you need to\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item switch on "{}\+Tint Black"{} under "{}\+Advanced..."{},
\item use the new {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Tint Black} shader, or your own shader that treats the UV2 and UV3 streams similarly.
\item Additionally, for Skeleton\+Graphic, you can use {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton\+Graphic Tint Black} (or the bundled Skeleton\+Graphic\+Tint\+Black material) or your own shader that uses UV2 and UV3 streams similarly. {\bfseries{Additional Shader Channels}} Tex\+Coord1 and Tex\+Coord2 will need to be enabled from the Canvas component\textquotesingle{}s inspector. These correspond to UV2 and UV3.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Clipping}} is now supported. Caution\+: The Skeleton\+Animation switches to slightly slower mesh generation code when clipping so limit your use of {\ttfamily Clipping\+Attachment}s when using on large numbers of skeletons.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Skeleton\+Renderer.\+initial\+Flip}} \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} components such as Skeleton\+Renderer, Skeleton\+Animation, Skeleton\+Animator now has {\ttfamily initial\+FlipX} and {\ttfamily initial\+FlipY} fields which are also visible in the inspector under "{}\+Advanced..."{}. It will allow you to set and preview a starting flip value for your skeleton component. This is applied immediately when the internal skeleton object is instantiated.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{[}Spine\+Attribute\mbox{]} Improvements}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Icons have been added to Spine\+Attribute\+Drawers}}. This should make your default inspectors easier to understand at a glance.
\item {\bfseries{Added Constraint Attributes}} You can now use {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\doxylink{class_spine_ik_constraint}{Spine\+Ik\+Constraint}\mbox{]}} {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\doxylink{class_spine_transform_constraint}{Spine\+Transform\+Constraint}\mbox{]}} {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\doxylink{class_spine_path_constraint}{Spine\+Path\+Constraint}\mbox{]}}
\item {\bfseries{Spine\+Attribute data\+Field}} parameter can also now detect sibling fields within arrays and serializable structs/classes.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{[}Spine\+Attribute(include\+None\+:false)\mbox{]}}} Spine\+Attributes now have an {\ttfamily include\+None} optional parameter to specify if you want to include or exclude a none ("{}"{}) value option in the dropdown menu. Default is {\ttfamily include\+None\+:true}.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{[}\doxylink{class_spine_attachment}{Spine\+Attachment}(skin\+Field\+:"{}my\+Skin"{})\mbox{]}}} The \doxylink{class_spine_attachment}{Spine\+Attachment} attribute now has a skin\+Field optional parameter to limit the dropdown items to attachments in a specific skin instead of the just default skin or all the skins in Skeleton\+Data.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Skeleton\+Debug\+Window}}. Debugging tools have been moved from the Skeleton\+Animation and Skeleton\+Utility component inspectors into its own utility window. You can access "{}\+Skeleton Debug"{} under the {\ttfamily Advanced...} foldout in the Skeleton\+Animation inspector, or in Skeleton\+Animation\textquotesingle{}s right-\/click/context menu.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Skeleton Baking Window}} The old Skeleton Baking feature is also now accessible through the Skeleton\+Data\+Asset\textquotesingle{}s right-\/click/context menu.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Attachment\+Tools source material}}. {\ttfamily Attachment\+Tools} methods can now accept a {\ttfamily source\+Material} argument to copy material properties from.
\item {\bfseries{Attachment\+Tools Skin Extensions}}. Using Attachment\+Tools, you can now add entries by slot name by also providing a skeleton argument. Also {\ttfamily Append(\+Skin)}, {\ttfamily Remove\+Attachment} and {\ttfamily Clear} have been added.
\item {\bfseries{Bone\+Follower and Skeleton\+Utility\+Bone Add Rigid\+Body Button}}. The Bone\+Follower and Skeleton\+Utility\+Bone component inspectors will now offer to add a {\ttfamily Rigidbody} or {\ttfamily Rigidbody2D} if it detects a collider of the appropriate type. Having a rigidbody on a moving transform with a collider fits better with the Unity physics systems and prevents excess calculations. It will not detect colliders on child objects so you have to add Rigidbody components manually accordingly.
\item {\bfseries{Skeleton\+Renderer.\+On\+Post\+Process\+Vertices}} is a new callback that gives you a reference to the Mesh\+Generator after it has generated a mesh from the current skeleton pose. You can access {\ttfamily mesh\+Generator.\+Vertex\+Buffer} or {\ttfamily mesh\+Generator.\+Color\+Buffer} to modify these before they get pushed into the Unity\+Engine.\+Mesh for rendering. This can be useful for non-\/shader vertex effects.
\item {\bfseries{Examples}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Examples now use properties}}. The code in the example scripts have been switched over to using properties instead of fields to encourage their use for consistency. This is in anticipation of both users who want to move the \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} folders to the Unity Plugins folder (compiled as a different assembly), and of Unity 2017\textquotesingle{}s ability to manually define different assemblies for shorter compilation times.
\item {\bfseries{Mix And Match}}. The mix-\/and-\/match example scene, code and data have been updated to reflect the current recommended setup for animation-\/compatible custom equip systems The underlying API has changed since 3.\+5 and the new API calls in Mix\+And\+Match.\+cs is recommended. Documentation is in progress.
\item {\bfseries{Sample Components}}. {\ttfamily Atas\+Region\+Attacher} and {\ttfamily Sprite\+Attacher} are now part of {\ttfamily Sample Components}, to reflect that they are meant to be used as sample code rather than production. \doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A} few other sample components have also been added. New imports of the unitypackage Examples folder will see a "{}\+Legacy"{} folder comprised of old sample components that no longer contain the most up-\/to-\/date and recommended workflows, but are kept in case old setups used them for production.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} folder}}. In the unitypackage, the "{}spine-\/csharp"{} and "{}spine-\/unity"{} folders are now inside a "{}\+Spine"{} folder. This change will only affect fresh imports. Importing the unitypackage to update Spine-\/\+Unity in your existing project will update the appropriate files however you chose to arrange them, as long as the meta files are intact.
\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Sprite shaders module was updated to the latest version from the \href{https://github.com/traggett/UnitySpriteShaders/commits/master}{\texttt{ source}}. Some changes were made to the underlying keyword structure. You may need to review the settings of your lit materials. Particularly, your Fixed Normals settings.
\item The {\ttfamily Spine/\+Skeleton Lit} shader was switched over to non-\/fixed-\/function code. It now no longer requires mesh normals and has fixed normals at the shader level.
\item The old Mesh\+Generator classes, interfaces and code in {\ttfamily Spine.\+Unity.\+Mesh\+Generation} are now deprecated. All mesh-\/generating components now share the class {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_spine_1_1_unity_1_1_mesh_generator}{Spine.\+Unity.\+Mesh\+Generator}} defined in {\ttfamily \doxylink{_spine_mesh_8cs}{Spine\+Mesh.\+cs}}. Mesh\+Generator is a serializable class.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer.\+render\+Meshes} optimization is currently non-\/functional.
\item Old triangle-\/winding code has been removed from {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. Please use shaders that have backface culling off.
\item Render settings in {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic} can now be accessed under {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+Mesh\+Generator.\+settings}. This is visible in the Skeleton\+Graphic inspector as {\ttfamily Advanced...}
\item We will continue to bundle the unitypackage with the empty .cs files of deprecated classes until \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} 3.\+7 to ensure the upgrade process does not break.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The \mbox{[}\doxylink{class_spine_attachment}{Spine\+Attachment(slot\+Field\+:)}\mbox{]} optional parameter found property value now acts as a \doxylink{struct_find}{Find(slot\+Name)} argument rather than Contains(slot\+Name).
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animator} now uses a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animator.\+Mecanim\+Translator} class to translate an Animator\textquotesingle{}s Mecanim \doxylink{struct_state}{State} Machine into skeleton poses. This makes code reuse possible for a Mecanim version of Skeleton\+Graphic.
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animator} {\ttfamily autoreset} and the {\ttfamily mix\+Modes} array are now a part of Skeleton\+Animator\textquotesingle{}s Mecanim\+Translator {\ttfamily .Translator}. {\ttfamily auto\+Reset} is set to {\ttfamily true} by default. Old prefabs and scene objects with Skeleton Animator may no longer have correct values set.
\item Warnings and conditionals checking for specific Unity 5.\+2-\/and-\/below incompatibility have been removed.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for clipping
\item Removed {\ttfamily Region\+Batcher} and {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Region\+Renderer}, renamed {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Mesh\+Renderer} to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}
\item Added support for two color tint. For it to work, you need to add the {\ttfamily Spine\+Effect.\+fx} file to your content project, then load it via {\ttfamily var effect = Content.\+Load\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Effect\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}("{}\+Spine\+Effect"{});}, and set it on the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. See the example project for code.
\item Added support for any {\ttfamily Effect} to be used by {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}
\item Added support for {\ttfamily IVertex\+Effect} to modify vertices of skeletons on the CPU. {\ttfamily IVertex\+Effect} instances can be set on the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. See example project.
\item Added {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Debug\+Renderer}
\item Made {\ttfamily Mesh\+Batcher} of Skeleton\+Renderer accessible via a getter. Allows user to batch their own geometry together with skeleton meshes for maximum batching instead of using XNA Sprite\+Batcher.

\item {\bfseries{Breaking changes}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton.\+get\+Bounds} takes a scratch array as input so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to allocate a new array on each invocation itself. Reduces GC activity.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Bone.\+world\+To\+Local\+RotationX} and {\ttfamily Bone.\+world\+To\+Local\+RotationY}. Replaced by {\ttfamily Bone.\+world\+To\+Local\+Rotation} (rotation given relative to x-\/axis, counter-\/clockwise, in degrees).
\item Added {\ttfamily stride} parameter to {\ttfamily Vertex\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices}.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+vertices} field. The vertices array is provided to {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices} by the API user now.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+update\+World\+Vertices}, added {\ttfamily Region\+Attachment.\+compute\+World\+Vertices}. The new method now computes the x/y positions of the 4 vertices of the corner and places them in the provided {\ttfamily world\+Vertices} array, starting at {\ttfamily offset}, then moving by {\ttfamily stride} array elements when advancing to the next vertex. This allows to directly compose the vertex buffer and avoids a copy. The computation of the full vertices, including vertex colors and texture coordinates, is now done by the backend\textquotesingle{}s respective renderer.
\item Skeleton attachments\+: Moved update of attached skeleton out of lib\+GDX {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}, added overloaded method {\ttfamily Skeleton\#update\+World\+Transform(\+Bone), used for}Skeleton\+Attachment{\ttfamily . You now MUST call this new method with the bone of the parent skeleton to which the child skeleton is attached. See}Skeleton\+Attachment\+Test\`{} for and example.
\item The completion event will fire for looped 0 duration animations every frame.

\item Added support for clipping. See {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Clipper}. Used automatically by {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. Does not work when using a {\ttfamily Sprite\+Batch} with {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. Use {\ttfamily Polygon\+Sprite\+Batch} or {\ttfamily Two\+Color\+Polygon\+Batch} instead.
\item Added {\ttfamily Vertex\+Effect} interface, instances of which can be set on {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. Allows to modify vertices before submitting them to GPU. See {\ttfamily Swirl\+Effect}, {\ttfamily Jitter\+Effect} and {\ttfamily Vertex\+Effect\+Test}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Web\+GL context loss
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Restorable} interface, implemented by any Web\+GL resource that needs restoration after a context loss. All Web\+GL resource classes ({\ttfamily Shader}, {\ttfamily Mesh}, {\ttfamily GLTexture}) implement this interface.
\item Added {\ttfamily Managed\+Web\+GLRendering\+Context}. Handles setup of a {\ttfamily Web\+GLRendering\+Context} given a canvas element and restoration of Web\+GL resources ({\ttfamily Shader}, {\ttfamily Mesh}, {\ttfamily GLTexture}) on Web\+GL context loss. Web\+GL resources register themselves with the {\ttfamily Managed\+Web\+GLRendering\+Context}. If the context is informed of a context loss and restoration, the registered Web\+GL resources\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily restore()} method is called. The {\ttfamily restore()} method implementation on each resource type will recreate the GPU side objects.
\item All classes that previously took a {\ttfamily Web\+GLRendering\+Context} in the constructor now also allow a {\ttfamily Managed\+Web\+GLRendering\+Context}. This ensures existing applications do not break.
\item To use automatic context restauration\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create or fetch a canvas element from the DOM
\item Instantiate a {\ttfamily Managed\+Web\+GLRendering\+Context}, passing the canvas to the constructor. This will setup a {\ttfamily Web\+GLRendering\+Context} internally and manage context loss/restoration.
\item Pass the {\ttfamily Managed\+Web\+GLRendering\+Context} to the constructors of classes that you previously passed a {\ttfamily Web\+GLRendering\+Context} to ({\ttfamily Asset\+Manager}, {\ttfamily GLTexture}, {\ttfamily Mesh}, {\ttfamily Shader}, {\ttfamily Polygon\+Batcher}, {\ttfamily Scene\+Renderer}, {\ttfamily Shape\+Renderer}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Debug\+Renderer}).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Fixed renderer to work with 3.\+6 changes.
\item Added support for two color tinting.
\item Improved performance by using {\ttfamily DYNAMIC\+\_\+\+DRAW} for vertex buffer objects and fixing bug that copied to much data to the GPU each frame in {\ttfamily Polygon\+Batcher}/{\ttfamily Mesh}.
\item Added two color tinting support, enabled by default. You can disable it via the constructors of {\ttfamily Scene\+Renderer}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}and {\ttfamily Polygon\+Batcher}. Note that you will need to use a shader created via {\ttfamily Shader.\+new\+Two\+Colored\+Textured\+Shader} shader with {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer} and {\ttfamily Polygon\+Batcher} if two color tinting is enabled.
\item Added clipping support
\item Added {\ttfamily Vertex\+Effect} interface, instances of which can be set on {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer}. Allows to modify vertices before submitting them to GPU. See {\ttfamily Swirl\+Effect}, {\ttfamily Jitter\+Effect}, and the example which allows to set effects.
\item Added {\ttfamily slot\+Range\+Start} and {\ttfamily slot\+Range\+End} parameters to {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Renderer\#draw} and {\ttfamily Scene\+Renderer\#draw\+Skeleton}. This allows you to render only a range of slots in the draw order. See {\ttfamily spine-\/ts/webgl/tests/test-\/slot-\/range.\+html} for an example.
