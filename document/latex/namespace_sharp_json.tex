Based on the JSON parser by Patrick van Bergen \href{http://techblog.procurios.nl/k/news/view/14605/14863/how-do-i-write-my-own-parser-(for-json).html}{\texttt{ http\+://techblog.\+procurios.\+nl/k/news/view/14605/14863/how-\/do-\/i-\/write-\/my-\/own-\/parser-\/(for-\/json).\+html}}

Changes made\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Optimized parser speed (deserialize roughly near 3x faster than original)
\item Added support to handle lexer/parser error messages with line numbers
\item Added more fine grained control over type conversions during the parsing
\item Refactory API (Separate \doxylink{class_sharp_json_1_1_lexer}{Lexer} code from Parser code and the Encoder from Decoder)
\end{DoxyItemize}
