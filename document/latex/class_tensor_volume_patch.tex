Patch extraction specialized for processing of volumetric data. This assumes that the input has a least 4 dimensions ordered as follows\+: 


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item channels
\item planes
\item rows
\item columns
\item (optional) additional dimensions such as time or batch size. Calling the volume patch code with patch\+\_\+planes, patch\+\_\+rows, and patch\+\_\+cols is equivalent to calling the regular patch extraction code with parameters d, patch\+\_\+planes, patch\+\_\+rows, patch\+\_\+cols, and 1 for all the additional dimensions.
