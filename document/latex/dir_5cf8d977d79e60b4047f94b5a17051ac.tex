GLFW is an Open Source, multi-\/platform library for Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-\/independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

GLFW natively supports Windows, mac\+OS and Linux and other Unix-\/like systems. On Linux both Wayland and X11 are supported.

GLFW is licensed under the \href{https://www.glfw.org/license.html}{\texttt{ zlib/libpng license}}.

You can \href{https://www.glfw.org/download.html}{\texttt{ download}} the latest stable release as source or Windows binaries. Each release starting with 3.\+0 also has a corresponding \href{https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases}{\texttt{ annotated tag}} with source and binary archives.

The \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/}{\texttt{ documentation}} is available online and is included in all source and binary archives. See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/news.html}{\texttt{ release notes}} for new features, caveats and deprecations in the latest release. For more details see the \href{https://www.glfw.org/changelog.html}{\texttt{ version history}}.

The {\ttfamily master} branch is the stable integration branch and {\itshape should} always compile and run on all supported platforms, although details of newly added features may change until they have been included in a release. New features and many bug fixes live in \href{https://github.com/glfw/glfw/branches/all}{\texttt{ other branches}} until they are stable enough to merge.

If you are new to GLFW, you may find the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html}{\texttt{ tutorial}} for GLFW 3 useful. If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html}{\texttt{ transition guide}} for moving to the GLFW 3 API.

GLFW exists because of the contributions of \doxysectlink{md_runtime_2glfw_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_o_r_s}{many people}{0} around the world, whether by reporting bugs, providing community support, adding features, reviewing or testing code, debugging, proofreading docs, suggesting features or fixing bugs.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md105}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Compiling GLFW}{Compiling GLFW}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md105}
GLFW is written primarily in C99, with parts of mac\+OS support being written in Objective-\/C. GLFW itself requires only the headers and libraries for your OS and window system. It does not need any additional headers for context creation APIs (WGL, GLX, EGL, NSGL, OSMesa) or rendering APIs (Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES, Vulkan) to enable support for them.

GLFW supports compilation on Windows with Visual C++ 2013 and later, Min\+GW and Min\+GW-\/w64, on mac\+OS with Clang and on Linux and other Unix-\/like systems with GCC and Clang. It will likely compile in other environments as well, but this is not regularly tested.

There are \href{https://www.glfw.org/download.html}{\texttt{ pre-\/compiled binaries}} available for all supported compilers on Windows and mac\+OS.

See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html}{\texttt{ compilation guide}} for more information about how to compile GLFW yourself.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md106}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Using GLFW}{Using GLFW}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md106}
See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/}{\texttt{ documentation}} for tutorials, guides and the API reference.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md107}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Contributing to GLFW}{Contributing to GLFW}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md107}

GLFW supports Windows XP and later and mac\+OS 10.\+11 and later. Linux and other Unix-\/like systems running the X Window System are supported even without a desktop environment or modern extensions, although some features require a running window or clipboard manager. The OSMesa backend requires Mesa 6.\+3.

See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html}{\texttt{ compatibility guide}} in the documentation for more information.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md109}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Dependencies}{Dependencies}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md109}
GLFW itself needs only CMake 3.\+16 or later and the headers and libraries for your OS and window system.

The examples and test programs depend on a number of tiny libraries. These are located in the {\ttfamily deps/} directory.
