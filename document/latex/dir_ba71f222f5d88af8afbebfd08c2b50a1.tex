\doxysubsection{详细描述}
This folder contains formatter configuration files to be used with IDEs as well as the \href{https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-gradle/README.md}{\texttt{ spotless}} formatter expressed in the Gradle project in this directory.

You will need the following on your {\ttfamily PATH}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item JDK 10+
\item clang-\/format 12.\+0.\+1 (i.\+e. {\ttfamily brew install clang-\/format}). Also set the environment variable {\ttfamily CLANGFORMAT} to the path of the {\ttfamily clang-\/format} executable.
\item dotnet format (i.\+e. {\ttfamily dotnet tool install -\/g dotnet-\/format}, comes with dotnet 6 out of the box)
\item tsfmt, (i.\+e. {\ttfamily npm install -\/g typescript-\/formatter})
\end{DoxyItemize}

To run the formatter, invoke the {\ttfamily format.\+sh} script. This will shuffle around the Gradle config files, invoke spotless, then undo the config file shuffling. Invoking {\ttfamily ./gradlew spotless\+Apply} from the {\ttfamily formatters/} directory will not work.
