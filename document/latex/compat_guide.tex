This guide describes the various API extensions used by this version of GLFW. It lists what are essentially implementation details, but which are nonetheless vital knowledge for developers intending to deploy their applications on a wide range of machines.

The information in this guide is not a part of GLFW API, but merely preconditions for some parts of the library to function on a given machine. Any part of this information may change in future versions of GLFW and that will not be considered a breaking API change.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_x11}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{X11 extensions, protocols and IPC standards}{X11 extensions, protocols and IPC standards}}\label{compat_guide_compat_x11}
As GLFW uses Xlib directly, without any intervening toolkit library, it has sole responsibility for interacting well with the many and varied window managers in use on Unix-\/like systems. In order for applications and window managers to work well together, a number of standards and conventions have been developed that regulate behavior outside the scope of the X11 API; most importantly the \href{https://www.tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/}{\texttt{ Inter-\/\+Client Communication Conventions Manual}} (ICCCM) and \href{https://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html}{\texttt{ Extended Window Manager Hints}} (EWMH) standards.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+MOTIF\+\_\+\+WM\+\_\+\+HINTS} window property to support borderless windows. If the running window manager does not support this property, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+DECORATED} hint will have no effect.

GLFW uses the ICCCM {\ttfamily WM\+\_\+\+DELETE\+\_\+\+WINDOW} protocol to intercept the user attempting to close the GLFW window. If the running window manager does not support this protocol, the close callback will never be called.

GLFW uses the EWMH {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+NET\+\_\+\+WM\+\_\+\+PING} protocol, allowing the window manager notify the user when the application has stopped responding, i.\+e. when it has ceased to process events. If the running window manager does not support this protocol, the user will not be notified if the application locks up.

GLFW uses the EWMH {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+NET\+\_\+\+WM\+\_\+\+STATE\+\_\+\+FULLSCREEN} window state to tell the window manager to make the GLFW window full screen. If the running window manager does not support this state, full screen windows may not work properly. GLFW has a fallback code path in case this state is unavailable, but every window manager behaves slightly differently in this regard.

GLFW uses the EWMH {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+NET\+\_\+\+WM\+\_\+\+BYPASS\+\_\+\+COMPOSITOR} window property to tell a compositing window manager to un-\/redirect full screen GLFW windows. If the running window manager uses compositing but does not support this property then additional copying may be performed for each buffer swap of full screen windows.

GLFW uses the \href{https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/ClipboardManager/}{\texttt{ clipboard manager protocol}} to push a clipboard string (i.\+e. selection) owned by a GLFW window about to be destroyed to the clipboard manager. If there is no running clipboard manager, the clipboard string will be unavailable once the window has been destroyed.

GLFW uses the \href{https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/XDND/}{\texttt{ X drag-\/and-\/drop protocol}} to provide file drop events. If the application originating the drag does not support this protocol, drag and drop will not work.

GLFW uses the XRandR 1.\+3 extension to provide multi-\/monitor support. If the running X server does not support this version of this extension, multi-\/monitor support will not function and only a single, desktop-\/spanning monitor will be reported.

GLFW uses the XRandR 1.\+3 and Xf86vidmode extensions to provide gamma ramp support. If the running X server does not support either or both of these extensions, gamma ramp support will not function.

GLFW uses the Xkb extension and detectable auto-\/repeat to provide keyboard input. If the running X server does not support this extension, a non-\/\+Xkb fallback path is used.

GLFW uses the XInput2 extension to provide raw, non-\/accelerated mouse motion when the cursor is disabled. If the running X server does not support this extension, regular accelerated mouse motion will be used.

GLFW uses both the XRender extension and the compositing manager to support transparent window framebuffers. If the running X server does not support this extension or there is no running compositing manager, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+TRANSPARENT\+\_\+\+FRAMEBUFFER} framebuffer hint will have no effect.

GLFW uses both the Xcursor extension and the freedesktop cursor conventions to provide an expanded set of standard cursor shapes. If the running X server does not support this extension or the current cursor theme does not support the conventions, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+RESIZE\+\_\+\+NWSE\+\_\+\+CURSOR}, {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+RESIZE\+\_\+\+NESW\+\_\+\+CURSOR} and {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+NOT\+\_\+\+ALLOWED\+\_\+\+CURSOR} shapes will not be available and other shapes may use legacy images.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_wayland}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Wayland protocols and IPC standards}{Wayland protocols and IPC standards}}\label{compat_guide_compat_wayland}
As GLFW uses libwayland directly, without any intervening toolkit library, it has sole responsibility for interacting well with every compositor in use on Unix-\/like systems. Most of the features are provided by the core protocol, while cursor support is provided by the libwayland-\/cursor helper library, EGL integration by libwayland-\/egl, and keyboard handling by \href{https://xkbcommon.org/}{\texttt{ libxkbcommon}}. In addition, GLFW uses some additional Wayland protocols to implement certain features if the compositor supports them.

GLFW uses xkbcommon 0.\+5.\+0 to provide key and text input support. Earlier versions are not supported.

GLFW uses the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/xdg-shell}{\texttt{ xdg-\/shell}} protocol to provide better window management. This protocol is mandatory for GLFW to display a window.

GLFW uses the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/relative-pointer-unstable-v1}{\texttt{ relative-\/pointer-\/unstable-\/v1}} protocol alongside the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/pointer-constraints-unstable-v1}{\texttt{ pointer-\/constraints-\/unstable-\/v1}} protocol to implement disabled cursor. If the running compositor does not support both of these protocols, disabling the cursor will have no effect.

GLFW uses the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/idle-inhibit-unstable-v1}{\texttt{ idle-\/inhibit-\/unstable-\/v1}} protocol to prohibit the screensaver from starting. If the running compositor does not support this protocol, the screensaver may start even for full screen windows.

GLFW uses the \href{https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libdecor/libdecor}{\texttt{ libdecor}} library for window decorations, where available. This in turn provides good quality client-\/side decorations (drawn by the application) on desktop systems that do not support server-\/side decorations (drawn by the window manager). On systems that do not provide either libdecor or xdg-\/decoration, very basic window decorations are provided. These do not include the window title or any caption buttons.

GLFW uses the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/xdg-decoration-unstable-v1}{\texttt{ xdg-\/decoration-\/unstable-\/v1}} protocol to request decorations to be drawn around its windows. This protocol is part of wayland-\/protocols 1.\+15, and mandatory at build time. If the running compositor does not support this protocol, a very simple frame will be drawn by GLFW itself, using the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/viewporter}{\texttt{ viewporter}} protocol alongside subsurfaces. If the running compositor does not support these protocols either, no decorations will be drawn around windows.

GLFW uses the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/xdg-activation-v1}{\texttt{ xdg-\/activation-\/v1}} protocol to implement window focus and attention requests. If the running compositor does not support this protocol, window focus and attention requests do nothing.

GLFW uses the \href{https://wayland.app/protocols/fractional-scale-v1}{\texttt{ fractional-\/scale-\/v1}} protocol to implement fine-\/grained framebuffer scaling. If the running compositor does not support this protocol, the \doxylink{group__window_gaa5a9c6b4722670fd33d6e8a88f2e21bc}{GLFW\+\_\+\+SCALE\+\_\+\+FRAMEBUFFER} window hint will only be able to scale the framebuffer by integer scales. This will typically be the smallest integer not less than the actual scale.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_glx}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{GLX extensions}{GLX extensions}}\label{compat_guide_compat_glx}
The GLX API is the default API used to create Open\+GL contexts on Unix-\/like systems using the X Window System.

GLFW uses the GLX 1.\+3 {\ttfamily \doxylink{x11__platform_8h_a9f71e9a6f1be02c687ab534ffecfaaf8}{GLXFBConfig}} functions to enumerate and select framebuffer pixel formats. If GLX 1.\+3 is not supported, \doxylink{group__init_gab41771f0215a2e0afb4cf1cf98082d40}{glfw\+Init} will fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+MESA\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control,} {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control} and {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+SGI\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control} extensions to provide vertical retrace synchronization (or {\itshape vsync}), in that order of preference. When none of these extensions are available, calling \doxylink{group__context_ga12a595c06947cec4967c6e1f14210a8a}{glfw\+Swap\+Interval} will have no effect.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+multisample} extension to create contexts with multisampling anti-\/aliasing. Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+SAMPLES} hint will have no effect.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+create\+\_\+context} extension when available, even when creating Open\+GL contexts of version 2.\+1 and below. Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+VERSION\+\_\+\+MAJOR} and {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+VERSION\+\_\+\+MINOR} hints will only be partially supported, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+DEBUG} hint will have no effect, and setting the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+PROFILE} or {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+FORWARD\+\_\+\+COMPAT} hints to {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+TRUE} will cause \doxylink{group__window_gaaccd00fafe81e2db94e8cdf55721e055}{glfw\+Create\+Window} to fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+create\+\_\+context\+\_\+profile} extension to provide support for context profiles. Where this extension is unavailable, setting the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+PROFILE} hint to anything but {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+ANY\+\_\+\+PROFILE}, or setting {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CLIENT\+\_\+\+API} to anything but {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+API} or {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+API} will cause \doxylink{group__window_gaaccd00fafe81e2db94e8cdf55721e055}{glfw\+Create\+Window} to fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+context\+\_\+flush\+\_\+control} extension to provide control over whether a context is flushed when it is released (made non-\/current). Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+RELEASE\+\_\+\+BEHAVIOR} hint will have no effect and the context will always be flushed when released.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+framebuffer\+\_\+s\+RGB} and {\ttfamily GLX\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+framebuffer\+\_\+s\+RGB} extensions to provide support for s\+RGB framebuffers. Where both of these extensions are unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+SRGB\+\_\+\+CAPABLE} hint will have no effect.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_wgl}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{WGL extensions}{WGL extensions}}\label{compat_guide_compat_wgl}
The WGL API is used to create Open\+GL contexts on Microsoft Windows and other implementations of the Win32 API, such as Wine.

GLFW uses either the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+extension\+\_\+string} or the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+extension\+\_\+string} extension to check for the presence of all other WGL extensions listed below. If both are available, the EXT one is preferred. If neither is available, no other extensions are used and many GLFW features related to context creation will have no effect or cause errors when used.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+swap\+\_\+control} extension to provide vertical retrace synchronization (or {\itshape vsync}). Where this extension is unavailable, calling \doxylink{group__context_ga12a595c06947cec4967c6e1f14210a8a}{glfw\+Swap\+Interval} will have no effect.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+pixel\+\_\+format} and {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+multisample} extensions to create contexts with multisampling anti-\/aliasing. Where these extensions are unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+SAMPLES} hint will have no effect.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+create\+\_\+context} extension when available, even when creating Open\+GL contexts of version 2.\+1 and below. Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+VERSION\+\_\+\+MAJOR} and {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+VERSION\+\_\+\+MINOR} hints will only be partially supported, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+DEBUG} hint will have no effect, and setting the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+PROFILE} or {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+FORWARD\+\_\+\+COMPAT} hints to {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+TRUE} will cause \doxylink{group__window_gaaccd00fafe81e2db94e8cdf55721e055}{glfw\+Create\+Window} to fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+create\+\_\+context\+\_\+profile} extension to provide support for context profiles. Where this extension is unavailable, setting the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+PROFILE} hint to anything but {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+ANY\+\_\+\+PROFILE} will cause \doxylink{group__window_gaaccd00fafe81e2db94e8cdf55721e055}{glfw\+Create\+Window} to fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+context\+\_\+flush\+\_\+control} extension to provide control over whether a context is flushed when it is released (made non-\/current). Where this extension is unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+RELEASE\+\_\+\+BEHAVIOR} hint will have no effect and the context will always be flushed when released.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+ARB\+\_\+framebuffer\+\_\+s\+RGB} and {\ttfamily WGL\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+framebuffer\+\_\+s\+RGB} extensions to provide support for s\+RGB framebuffers. When both of these extensions are unavailable, the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+SRGB\+\_\+\+CAPABLE} hint will have no effect.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_osx}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Open\+GL on mac\+OS}{Open\+GL on mac\+OS}}\label{compat_guide_compat_osx}
mac\+OS (as of version 14) still provides Open\+GL but it has been deprecated by Apple. While the API is still available, it is poorly maintained and frequently develops new issues. On modern systems, Open\+GL is implemented on top of Metal and is not fully thread-\/safe.

mac\+OS does not support Open\+GL stereo rendering. If the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+STEREO} hint is set to true, Open\+GL context creation will always fail.

mac\+OS only supports Open\+GL core profile contexts that are forward-\/compatible, but the {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+OPENGL\+\_\+\+FORWARD\+\_\+\+COMPAT} hint is ignored since GLFW 3.\+4. Even if this hint is set to false (the default), a forward-\/compatible context will be returned if available.

mac\+OS does not support Open\+GL debug contexts, no-\/error contexts or robustness. The {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+DEBUG}, {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+ERROR} and {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+ROBUSTNESS} hints will be ignored and a context without these features will be returned.

mac\+OS does not flush Open\+GL contexts when they are made non-\/current. The {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+CONTEXT\+\_\+\+RELEASE\+\_\+\+BEHAVIOR} hint is ignored and the release behavior will always be the equivalent of {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+RELEASE\+\_\+\+BEHAVIOR\+\_\+\+NONE}. If you need a context to be flushed, call {\ttfamily gl\+Flush} before making it non-\/current.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_vulkan}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Vulkan loader and API}{Vulkan loader and API}}\label{compat_guide_compat_vulkan}
By default, GLFW uses the standard system-\/wide Vulkan loader to access the Vulkan API on all platforms except mac\+OS. This is installed by both graphics drivers and Vulkan SDKs. If either the loader or at least one minimally functional ICD is missing, \doxylink{group__vulkan_ga72e7c3757d9ff2333181a5569bb7c403}{glfw\+Vulkan\+Supported} will return {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+FALSE} and all other Vulkan-\/related functions will fail with an \doxylink{group__errors_ga56882b290db23261cc6c053c40c2d08e}{GLFW\+\_\+\+API\+\_\+\+UNAVAILABLE} error.\hypertarget{compat_guide_compat_wsi}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Vulkan WSI extensions}{Vulkan WSI extensions}}\label{compat_guide_compat_wsi}
The Vulkan WSI extensions are used to create Vulkan surfaces for GLFW windows on all supported platforms.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+surface} and {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+win32\+\_\+surface} extensions to create surfaces on Microsoft Windows. If any of these extensions are not available, \doxylink{group__vulkan_gada152edc5bbbd0c2138728878632fd9c}{glfw\+Get\+Required\+Instance\+Extensions} will return an empty list and window surface creation will fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+surface} and either the {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+MVK\+\_\+macos\+\_\+surface} or {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+metal\+\_\+surface} extensions to create surfaces on mac\+OS. If any of these extensions are not available, \doxylink{group__vulkan_gada152edc5bbbd0c2138728878632fd9c}{glfw\+Get\+Required\+Instance\+Extensions} will return an empty list and window surface creation will fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+surface} and either the {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+xlib\+\_\+surface} or {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+xcb\+\_\+surface} extensions to create surfaces on X11. If {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+surface} or both {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+xlib\+\_\+surface} and {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+xcb\+\_\+surface} are not available, \doxylink{group__vulkan_gada152edc5bbbd0c2138728878632fd9c}{glfw\+Get\+Required\+Instance\+Extensions} will return an empty list and window surface creation will fail.

GLFW uses the {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+surface} and {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+wayland\+\_\+surface} extensions to create surfaces on Wayland. If any of these extensions are not available, \doxylink{group__vulkan_gada152edc5bbbd0c2138728878632fd9c}{glfw\+Get\+Required\+Instance\+Extensions} will return an empty list and window surface creation will fail.
