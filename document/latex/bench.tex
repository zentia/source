We tested {\itshape mimalloc} against many other top allocators over a wide range of benchmarks, ranging from various real world programs to synthetic benchmarks that see how the allocator behaves under more extreme circumstances.

In our benchmarks, {\itshape mimalloc} always outperforms all other leading allocators ({\itshape jemalloc}, {\itshape tcmalloc}, {\itshape Hoard}, etc) (Jan 2021), and usually uses less memory (up to 25\% more in the worst case). A nice property is that it does {\itshape consistently} well over the wide range of benchmarks.

See the \href{https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc\#Performance}{\texttt{ Performance}} section in the {\itshape mimalloc} repository for benchmark results, or the the technical report for detailed benchmark results.
