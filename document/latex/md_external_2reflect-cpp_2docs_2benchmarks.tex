reflect-\/cpp conducts continuuous benchmarking across different operating systems, compilers and architectures and publishes the results on its \href{https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp/actions}{\texttt{ Actions tab}}. Refer to the \href{https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp/tree/main/benchmarks}{\texttt{ benchmarks folder}} for details.

The benchmarks show that reflect-\/cpp is not only very convenient, but also one the fastest JSON libraries for C++. It is faster than Rapid\+JSON and about 10 times faster than nlohmann/json. It can be even faster than that, if you choose to use a different format supported by reflect-\/cpp, such as msgpack.
