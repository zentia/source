Vcpkg is a community driven effort to build a productive and robust ecosystem of native libraries -\/ your contributions are invaluable!\hypertarget{md_external_2reflect-cpp_2vcpkg_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md742}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Issues}{Issues}}\label{md_external_2reflect-cpp_2vcpkg_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md742}
The easiest way to contribute is by reporting issues with either {\ttfamily vcpkg.\+exe} or an existing package on \href{https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub}}. When reporting an issue with {\ttfamily vcpkg.\+exe}, make sure to clearly state\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The machine setup\+: "{}\+I\textquotesingle{}m using Windows 10 Anniversary Update. My machine is using the fr-\/fr locale. I successfully ran \textquotesingle{}install boost\textquotesingle{}."{}
\item The steps to reproduce\+: "{}\+I run \textquotesingle{}vcpkg list\textquotesingle{}"{}
\item The outcome you expected\+: "{}\+I expected to see \textquotesingle{}boost\+:x86-\/windows\textquotesingle{}"{}
\item The actual outcome\+: "{}\+I get no output at all"{} or "{}\+I get a crash dialog"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

When reporting an issue with a package, make sure to clearly state\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The machine setup (as above)
\item What package and version you\textquotesingle{}re building\+: "{}opencv 3.\+1.\+0"{}
\item Any relevant error logs from the build process.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_external_2reflect-cpp_2vcpkg_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md743}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Pull Requests}{Pull Requests}}\label{md_external_2reflect-cpp_2vcpkg_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md743}
We are happy to accept pull requests for fixes, features, new packages, and updates to existing packages. In order to avoid wasting your time, we highly encourage opening an issue to discuss whether the PR you\textquotesingle{}re thinking about making will be acceptable. This is doubly true for features and new packages.\hypertarget{md_external_2reflect-cpp_2vcpkg_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md744}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{New package Guidelines}{New package Guidelines}}\label{md_external_2reflect-cpp_2vcpkg_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md744}
We\textquotesingle{}re glad you\textquotesingle{}re interested in submitting a new package! Here are some guidelines to help you author an excellent portfile\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Avoid functional patches. Patches should be considered a last resort to implement compatibility when there\textquotesingle{}s no other way.
\item When patches can\textquotesingle{}t be avoided, do not modify the default behavior. The ideal lifecycle of a patch is to get merged upstream and no longer be needed. Try to keep this goal in mind when deciding how to patch something.
\item Prefer to use the {\ttfamily vcpkg\+\_\+xyz} functions over raw {\ttfamily execute\+\_\+command} calls. This makes long term maintenance easier when new features (such as custom compiler flags or generators) are added.
