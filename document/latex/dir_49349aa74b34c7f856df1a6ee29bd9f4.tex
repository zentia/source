\doxysubsection{详细描述}
The latest version of this documentation can also be found at the \mbox{[}spine-\/unity Runtime Documentation\mbox{]}(\href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity\#Timeline-Extension-UPM-Package}{\texttt{ http\+://esotericsoftware.\+com/spine-\/unity\#\+Timeline-\/\+Extension-\/\+UPM-\/\+Package}}) webpage.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1132}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Timeline Extension UPM Package}{Timeline Extension UPM Package}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1132}


Timeline support is provided as a separate UPM (Unity Package Manager) package. See section Optional Extension UPM Packages on how to download and install this package and section Updating an Extension UPM Package on how to update it.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1133}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Spine-\/\+Unity Timeline Playables}{Spine-\/\+Unity Timeline Playables}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1133}


\doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Timeline currently provides three types of Timeline Playables\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track} {\itshape (animates {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation})},
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic Track} {\itshape (animates {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic})},
\item {\ttfamily Skeleton Flip Track} {\itshape (flips {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic})}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Note\+: Timeline tracks have been renamed in recent versions to improve readability. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track} was called {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Track}, ~\newline
 {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic Track} was called {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Graphic Track}, ~\newline
 {\ttfamily Skeleton Flip Track} was called {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Skeleton Flip Track}. \end{quote}


{\bfseries{Limitations\+:}} currently only Skeleton\+Animation and Skeleton\+Graphic are supported. There is currently no Timeline support for Skeleton\+Mecanim.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1134}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Skeleton\+Animation Track and Skeleton\+Graphic Track}{Skeleton\+Animation Track and Skeleton\+Graphic Track}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1134}
 ~\newline


These track types can be used to set animations at the Animation\+State of the target {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation} or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}. Track type {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track} is used for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation}, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic Track} for {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}.

 ~\newline


{\bfseries{Parameters}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Track Index.} The target Animation\+State track index to set animations at. Do not forget to set this value accordingly when using multiple timeline tracks. \begin{quote}
{\bfseries{Important Note\+:}} Currently it is required to order the timeline tracks with base track at the top and overlay tracks below, otherwise the Editor Preview will display incorrect results. \end{quote}

\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Unscaled Time.} Whenever starting a new animation clip of this track, {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation.\+Unscaled\+Time} (or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic.\+Unscaled\+Time} respectively) will be set to this value. This allows you to play back Timeline clips either in normal game time or unscaled game time. Note that {\ttfamily Playable\+Director.\+Update\+Method} is ignored and replaced by this property, which allows more fine-\/granular control per Timeline track.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1135}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Spine Animation State Clip}{Spine Animation State Clip}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1135}
You can add a {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation \doxylink{struct_state}{State} Clip} to a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track} (or {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic Track}) by dragging an {\ttfamily Animation\+Reference\+Asset} onto a Timeline track. See the Skeleton\+Data -\/ Preview section on how to generate {\ttfamily Animation\+Reference\+Assets} for a {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Data\+Asset}.

 ~\newline


{\bfseries{Parameters}} ~\newline
 {\itshape Clip Timing}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Clip In.} An initial local start time offset applied when playing this animation. Can also be adjusted by dragging the left edge of the clip.
\item {\itshape Blend In Duration.} Blend transition duration used when {\ttfamily Use Blend Duration} is enabled and {\ttfamily Default Mix Duration} is disabled. Can be adjusted by moving the clip into the previous clip, resulting in a cross-\/fade triangle at the transition.
\item {\itshape Speed Multiplier.} Playback speed multiplier. When set to 2.\+0 it will play the animation twice as fast, when set to 0.\+5 half as fast.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation \doxylink{struct_state}{State} Clip}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Don\textquotesingle{}t Pause with Director.} If set to true, the animation will continue playing when the Director is paused.
\item {\itshape Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip.} Normally when empty space follows the clip on the timeline, the empty animation is set on the track. Set this parameter to true to continue playing the clip\textquotesingle{}s animation instead.
\item {\itshape Clip End Mix Out Duration.} When {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip} is false, and the clip is followed by blank space or stopped, the empty animation is set with this {\ttfamily Mix\+Duration}. When set to a value less than 0, the clip is paused instead.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape Mixing Setting}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Default Mix Duration.} When disabled, the value under {\ttfamily Mix Duration} below is used for transitions from the previous animation to this animation. When enabled, it will use the setup {\ttfamily Mix Duration} value at the Skeleton\+Data asset for the animation pair.
\item {\itshape Use Blend Duration.} When enabled, the value under {\ttfamily Mix Duration} will be synced with the timeline clip transition duration \textquotesingle{}Ease In Duration\textquotesingle{}. Enable this value to adjust transition durations by moving the clip into the previous clip, resulting in a cross-\/fade triangle at the transition.
\item {\itshape Mix Duration.} When {\itshape Default Mix Duration} is disabled, this mix duration is used for transitions from the previous animation to this animation.
\item {\itshape Event Threshold.} See \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-api-reference\#TrackEntry-eventThreshold}{\texttt{ Track\+Entry.\+Event\+Threshold}}.
\item {\itshape Attachment Threshold.} See \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-api-reference\#TrackEntry-attachmentThreshold}{\texttt{ Track\+Entry.\+Attachment\+Threshold}}.
\item {\itshape Draw Order Threshold.} See \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-api-reference\#TrackEntry-drawOrderThreshold}{\texttt{ Track\+Entry.\+Draw\+Order\+Threshold}}.
\item {\itshape Alpha.} See \href{http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-api-reference\#TrackEntry-alpha}{\texttt{ Track\+Entry.\+Alpha}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape Ignored Parameters}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Ease Out Duration, Blend Curves}. These parameters are ignored and have no effect.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Note\+: {\itshape Default Mix Duration} was previously called {\itshape Custom Duration} and inverted. This has been changed to improve readability. \end{quote}


{\bfseries{Usage}}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation\+Playable\+Handle} component to your Skeleton\+Animation Game\+Object, or the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Playable\+Handle} in case of {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}.
\item With an existing Unity Playable Director, and in the Unity Timeline window, right-\/click on an empty space on the left and choose {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}} -\/ {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation Track}.
\item Drag the Skeleton\+Animation or Skeleton\+Graphic Game\+Object onto the empty reference property of the new \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Animation\+State Track.
\item To add an animation at a track, drag the respective \`{}\+Animation\+Reference\+Asset\`{} into the clips view (the right part of the Timeline panel) as you would with normal animation clips.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

See spine-\/unity Runtime Documentation, section Preview on how to create an {\ttfamily Animation\+Reference\+Asset} for each of your animations.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} You can use the Duplicate function ({\ttfamily CTRL}/{\ttfamily CMD} + {\ttfamily D}) to duplicate selected clips in the clips view. \end{quote}


{\bfseries{Track Behavior}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Animation\+State.\+Set\+Animation()} will be called at the beginning of every clip based on the {\ttfamily Animation\+Reference\+Asset}.
\item Clip durations matter since Timeline version 4.\+0. \begin{quote}
Note\+: Behaviour of version 3.\+8 was that clip durations don\textquotesingle{}t matter. Animations were not cleared when reaching empty space after a clip on the timeline. \end{quote}

\item \doxylink{test__containers_8cpp_ac3e3346bc6f9bb504e43495424c91a51}{Empty} animation\+: If a clip has no {\ttfamily Animation\+Reference\+Asset} assigned, it will call {\ttfamily Set\+Empty\+Animation} instead.
\item Error handling\+: If the animation with the provided {\ttfamily Animation\+Reference\+Asset} is not found, it will do nothing (the previous animation will continue playing normally).
\item Animations playing before the timeline starts playing will not be interrupted until the first clip starts playing.
\item What happens at the end of clips and at the end of the timeline depends on clip settings. When {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip} is true, nothing happens at the clip\textquotesingle{}s end. This means the effect of the last clip\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Set\+Animation} call will persist until you issue other calls at the Animation\+State. If {\ttfamily Don\textquotesingle{}t End with Clip} is false, it will be mix out to the empty animation with duration {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration}, or paused when {\ttfamily Clip End Mix Out Duration} is less than 0.
\item Edit mode preview mixing may look different from Play \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode} mixing. Please check in actual Play \doxylink{monitors_8c_a46c8a310cf4c094f8c80e1cb8dc1f911}{Mode} to see the actual results. Please see the remark in the Spine Animation\+State Track section on correct track ordering when previewing multiple overlaid tracks.

{\bfseries{Parameters}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Flip X.} Flips the skeleton along the X axis during the extents of the clip.
\item {\itshape Flip Y.} Flips the skeleton along the Y axis during the extents of the clip.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Usage}}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Animation\+Playable\+Handle} component to your Skeleton\+Animation Game\+Object, or the {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic\+Playable\+Handle} in case of {\ttfamily Skeleton\+Graphic}.
\item With an existing Unity Playable Director, and in the Unity Timeline window, right-\/click on an empty space on the left and choose {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine}} -\/ {\ttfamily Skeleton Flip Track}.
\item Drag the Skeleton\+Animation or Skeleton\+Graphic Game\+Object onto the empty reference property of the new \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Skeleton Flip Track.
\item Right-\/click on the row in an empty space in the Timeline dopesheet and choose {\ttfamily Add \doxylink{namespace_spine}{Spine} Skeleton Flip Clip}.
\item Adjust the start and end times of the new clip, name it appropriately at the top of the Inspector, and choose the desired FlipX and FlipY values.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\bfseries{Track Behavior}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The specified skeleton flip values will be applied for every frame within the duration of each track.
\item At the end of the timeline, the track will revert the skeleton flip to the flip values it captures when it starts playing that timeline.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Console potentially logs an incorrect and harmless error {\ttfamily Driven\+Property\+Manager has failed to register property "{}m\+\_\+\+Script"{} of object "{}\+Spine Game\+Object (spineboy-\/pro)"{} with driver "{}"{} because the property doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist.}. This is a known issue on Unity\textquotesingle{}s end.
