With the 2.\+0 release, \doxylink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}\textquotesingle{}s API is, to a large extent, stable. However, we wish to retain the freedom to make API incompatible changes. To that effect, we call many parts of \doxylink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen} "{}experimental"{} which means that they are not subject to API stability guarantee.

Our goal is that for the 2.\+1 release (expected in July 2009) most of these parts become API-\/stable too.

We are aware that API stability is a major concern for our users. That\textquotesingle{}s why it\textquotesingle{}s a priority for us to reach it, but at the same time we\textquotesingle{}re being serious about not calling \doxylink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen} API-\/stable too early.

Experimental features may at any time\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item be removed; \item be subject to an API incompatible change; \item introduce API or ABI incompatible changes in your own code if you let them affect your API or ABI.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{_experimental_Experimental_modules}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Experimental modules}{Experimental modules}}\label{_experimental_Experimental_modules}
The following modules are considered entirely experimental, and we make no firm API stability guarantee about them for the time being\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SVD \item QR \item Cholesky \item \doxylink{struct_eigen_1_1_sparse}{Sparse} \item Geometry (this one should be mostly stable, but it\textquotesingle{}s a little too early to make a formal guarantee)\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{_experimental_Experimental_core}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Experimental parts of the Core module}{Experimental parts of the Core module}}\label{_experimental_Experimental_core}
In the Core module, the only classes subject to ABI stability guarantee (meaning that you can use it for data members in your public ABI) is\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix}{Matrix} \item \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_map}{Map}\end{DoxyItemize}
All other classes offer no ABI guarantee, e.\+g. the layout of their data can be changed.

The only classes subject to (even partial) API stability guarantee (meaning that you can safely construct and use objects) are\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix_base}{Matrix\+Base} \+: partial API stability (see below) \item \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix}{Matrix} \+: full API stability (except for experimental stuff inherited from \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix_base}{Matrix\+Base}) \item \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_map}{Map} \+: full API stability (except for experimental stuff inherited from \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix_base}{Matrix\+Base})\end{DoxyItemize}
All other classes offer no direct API guarantee, e.\+g. their methods can be changed; however notice that most classes inherit \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix_base}{Matrix\+Base} and that this is where most of their API comes from -- so in practice most of the API is stable.

\doxylink{bench__gemm_8cpp_addc86e8508f14411ec98f521c520f875}{A} few \doxylink{class_eigen_1_1_matrix_base}{Matrix\+Base} methods are considered experimental, hence not part of any API stability guarantee\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item all methods documented as internal \item all methods hidden in the Doxygen documentation \item all methods marked as experimental \item all methods defined in experimental modules \end{DoxyItemize}
